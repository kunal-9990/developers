        <p><b>Fusion RCT</b> (RCT) lets you perform a complete corporate tax return directly from CaseWare Cloud. In addition to all standard federal and provincial forms, RCT contains worksheets specifically designed to streamline the process of completing the return. RCT was designed and developed in partnership with the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) to ensure compliance, and links up with the CRA’s Auto-fill service to import up to five prior years’ tax data. When you’ve completed the return, you can access the CRA’s EFILE service from the RCT interface, or you can print a hard copy for the client to review and file themselves.</p>
        <h2>Create your engagement</h2>
        <p>To get started, create a new Fusion RCT engagement file. When you create your new engagement, you can also set key dates and budgets and assign staff members to the file to prepare and review the engagement work.</p>
        <p><b>To create a new Fusion RCT engagement:</b>
        </p>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Fusion RCT</b>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Select the <b>New</b> button.</li>
            <li value="2">In the <b>Fusion RCT</b> dialog, choose your client <b>Entity</b>, enter a name for the engagement file and specify the year of the engagement. You can also select a <b>Start Date</b> and <b>End Date</b> for your engagement and enter budget information. You can also carry forward data from an existing engagement. See <a href="../../Engagements/File-Preparation/Carry-forward-an-engagement.htm" class="MCXref xref">Carry forward an engagement</a> for information.</li>
            <li value="3">In the <b>Preparer</b> field, enter your name and select yourself from the drop-down list. You are now assigned as the preparer.</li>
            <li value="4">In the <b>Reviewer</b> field, enter another staff member’s name. Select them from the list to assign them as a reviewer. </li>
            <li value="5">Select <b>Save</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have created your new engagement, and you have assigned staff in the firm to prepare the engagement and to review it. When you select <b>Save</b>, the engagement file is automatically opened in your browser.</p>
        <h3>Set the workflow status, reporting period and year end date</h3>
        <p>When you first open the engagement, a pop-up appears in the top-left displaying the engagement’s <b>Workflow</b> status. The Workflow status lets clients and other stakeholders know how far along in the engagement process you are. If you intend to start working on the engagement right away, set the Workflow status to <b>In Progress</b>.</p>
        <p>Select the desired <b>Reporting period</b>. </p>
        <p>With the pop-up still open, set the engagement’s <b>Year end date</b>. Note that an incorrect year-end date will affect trial balance imports.</p>
        <p>Select <b>Save</b>. You will now see the engagement’s <b>Documents</b> page.</p>
        <h2>Set up your tax engagement</h2>
        <p>To enable RCT’s tax features, you’ll need to complete certain procedures on the <b>0-10 Optimiser</b> checklist. If you only want to perform a corporate tax return,  select <b>Corporation Tax only</b> as the type of engagement being performed. If you want to perform a review or compilation engagement along with the tax return, select <b>Review and Corporation Tax</b> or <b>Compilation and Corporation Tax</b> as appropriate.</p>
        <p>Complete the rest of the checklist as appropriate.</p>
        <p>For more on Review and Compilation engagements, see <a href="Perform-an-engagement-in-Fusion-RCT.htm" class="MCXref xref">Perform an engagement in Fusion RCT</a>.</p>
        <h3>Complete the tax optimiser checklist</h3>
        <p>Return to the Documents page and select the <b>T-01 TOC - Tax optimiser checklist</b> document. As with the first Optimiser checklist, your responses will determine the documents that will make up your Tax engagement. Some responses will be automatically pulled from your firm's Cloud Profile. Complete the procedures and perform sign-off on the document.</p>
        <h3>Customize the engagement letter</h3>
        <p>RCT contains a standard engagement letter for outlining the engagement parameters with your client. To customize the letter’s contents, select <b>Edit</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2019/webapps/30/Content/en/Resources//Icons/SE icons/edit-icon-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) and either edit the pre-existing content, or just paste in your firm’s preferred content. When you’re done, select the appropriate Sign Off status. You can print the letter to PDF or hard copy by selecting <b>Print</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2019/webapps/30/Content/en/Resources//Icons/SE icons/Print-icon.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>
        <h3>Import tax data</h3>
        <p>If your firm has already imported the client’s trial balance data as part of a Compilation or Review engagement for this client, the data will already be available for use in your tax forms. Otherwise, you’ll need to perform the import yourself.</p>
        <p>RCT offers a variety of options for importing client data. You can access all import options from within any Tax form by selecting <b>Import</b>.</p>
        <h4>Import from GIFI</h4>
        <p>Select this option if you have a file in .gfi format containing the client’s GIFI data. Select <b>GIFI</b>, then browse for the .gfi file on your computer and select <b>Open</b>.</p>
        <h4>Import from TaxPrep</h4>
        <p>Select this option if you have a .CSV format output file exported from TaxPrep. If you’re unsure how to export a .CSV file from TaxPrep, follow the instructions below.</p>
        <p><b>To export a .CSV file from TaxPrep:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Open the client file in TaxPrep.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Perform a Roll Forward.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <b>File | Export Tax Return...</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Make sure the File Type is set to <b>.csv</b>, then select <b>OK</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Enter a file name and path, then select <b>Save</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In your open RCT tax document, select <b>Import | TaxPrep CSV</b> and browse for the exported file. Select <b>Open</b> to perform the import.</p>
        <h4>Import from the CRA</h4>
        <p>If your client is registered for the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA)'s T2 Auto-fill program, you can import the engagement's tax data automatically based on the client's previously filed returns.</p>
        <p><b>To transfer tax engagement data from the CRA:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>In any open CRT Tax document, select <b>Import | T2 Auto-fill</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select <b>Yes</b> in the prompt that follows.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>The CRA website opens in a new browser tab. Log into your CRA account using your credentials. On the request confirmation page, select <b>Next</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Select the data types you want to import into your engagement, then select <b>Download</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>You will be asked to compare the values from the CRA against the existing values that have already been entered for the fields, if any. The CRA values are displayed in the left column, while the engagement's current values are displayed on the right. For each line, select the checkbox on the right to use the CRA value. To use the CRA values for all lines, select the large checkbox at the top of the modal. When you're done, select <b>Transfer</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>The values are transferred to your engagement and a confirmation modal is displayed. Select <b>5 Year History</b> to review the historical data, or select <b>Close</b>.</p>
                <p>From here, you can go into the <b>AFR - AutoFill</b> worksheet (under the <b>Worksheets</b> folder in <b>Documents</b>) to review the auto-fill data that was transferred. This document is accessible once you click <b>Yes</b> to the question <b>Is the corporation inactive</b> in the <b>Tax Optimiser Checklist</b>. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The CRA-provided data is imported into your engagement.</p>
        <h4>Import from CaseWare Working Papers</h4>
        <p>CloudBridge is an add-on for CaseWare Working Papers that lets you link a Working Papers engagement file to a Cloud entity to import your engagement's trial balance and GIFI data into your RCT engagement. </p>
        <p>To learn more, go to <a href="../../Engagements/File-Preparation/Import-engagement-data-from-CaseWare-Working-Papers-to-Fusion-RCT.htm" class="MCXref xref">Import engagement data from CaseWare Working Papers to Fusion RCT</a>.</p>
        <h3>Complete the tax forms</h3>
        <p>With your client’s data now populating your RCT engagement forms, you can begin the tax engagement work. Start by completing the Tax Preparer Profile document, which requires you to enter detailed information about your firm. Some fields will be automatically filled if your firm has completed its Cloud firm profile.</p>
        <p>Because you completed the Tax Optimiser document, RCT will only list the documents that are relevant to your tax engagement.  To see all forms available in RCT, select <b>More Actions</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2019/webapps/30/Content/en/Resources//Icons/Ellipsis-20x16.png" />) <b>| Hidden Items</b>, or open the <b>Tax Forms List</b> document.</p>
        <p>Your Optimiser selections determine which worksheets, if any, are added to the <b>Documents</b> list. Worksheets are documents designed to streamline your engagement work.</p>
        <h3>Navigate between documents</h3>
        <p>Fusion RCT  makes it easy to navigate between worksheets and their related schedules as you complete the return. The RCT interface offers two options for moving between these documents.</p>
        <h4>Jump to source</h4>
        <p>When you select a field that has a single source, you will see this dialog. </p>
        <p>When you select Jump to Source,  the source document opens and jumps directly to the appropriate line, with the source field highlighted in flashing blue.</p>
        <h4>Viewer</h4>
        <p>In documents where an entire row of data is derived from one specific source document, you’ll see a visibility icon (<img src="/documentation_files/2019/webapps/30/Content/en/Resources//Icons/SE icons/visibility-icon-visible-20x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) to the right of the row. This feature opens the linked document in a pop-up display without opening a new browser window or tab. For example, each class listed in the <b>S8 - Capital Class Allocation</b> document is linked to its corresponding page from the CCA Worksheet.</p>
        <h3>Correct errors with your return</h3>
        <p>If there are any outstanding issues with your return, you will be unable to file it.</p>
        <p><b>To correct an error in RCT:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Select the <b>Diagnostics</b> tab in the toolbar to display a list of issues.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select an issue to open it, then select the hyperlink that displays to jump to the relevant document at the line containing the error.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Fix the highlighted error, then return to the <b>Diagnostics</b> tab.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Hover your pointer over the issue and select the <b>First Review</b> and <b>Second Review</b> checkmarks as required. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once all issues have been addressed, you’re ready to file your client’s corporate tax return.</p>
        <h3>File or print the tax return</h3>
        <p>Fusion RCT lets you file the completed return with the CRA. To do this, you must have the appropriate credentials already set up. Alternatively, you can export the return as a PDF file and then either share it electronically or print a hard copy.</p>
        <h4>File the return via EFILE</h4>
        <p>With the tax data imported, the engagement work complete, and all outstanding issues fixed, you can begin your electronic filing via the CRA's EFILE program. Select <b>EFILE</b> from the top menu to open the EFILE information page.</p>
        <p>From this page, you can file your return to the CRA via one of two sets of credentials. If your firm is a Certified Tax Preparer, you can enter your <b>CRA Login Information</b>. Alternatively, you can enter a <b>WACode (Web Access Code)</b> provided by the client.</p>
        <p>If you require a Web Access Code and have not yet been provided with one, select <b>WAC - Web Access Code Online Request</b> and complete the request form.</p>
        <h4>Print a hard copy of the return</h4>
        <p>If your client requests a copy of the return for their records, you can create a PDF file directly from Fusion RCT. This can be saved to disk and shared with your client electronically or printed as a hard copy. </p>
        <p>Select <b>Print</b> from any open tax document to select the document or return you want to print.</p>
