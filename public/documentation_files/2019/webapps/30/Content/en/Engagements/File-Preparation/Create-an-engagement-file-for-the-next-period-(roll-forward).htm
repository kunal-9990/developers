        <p>When the period for the engagement is coming to a close, you'll want to create an engagement file for the next period. </p>
        <p>In Working Papers, the process of completing an engagement is known as a Year End Close. During this process, you can also create a new file for the next period; this is known as a Roll Forward. In a Roll Forward, the current file's closing balances are used to define the opening balances in the new file.</p>
        <h2 id="year-end-close">Performing a year end close</h2>
        <p>You can perform a year end close on a Working Papers file when all work for the engagement is complete. By doing this, you create a new Working Papers file and rolling forward chosen balances and data to set up next year’s file.</p>
        <p><b>To perform a year end close:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Owner</i> role or equivalent permissions for the Working Papers file.</p>
            </li>

        <p>Working Papers will perform the year end close, and once the process is finished, it will automatically open the new file for next year.</p>
        <p>When you perform a year end close on a published file, you also create a placeholder for the file under the client entity. Cloud displays the placeholder, but the file cannot be opened until you publish your local copy.</p>

        <p>You have successfully published your Working Papers file to Cloud. This creates a parent copy of the file on Cloud, and you can now share it with other staff members. The parent copy replaces the placeholder that was created when you first performed the year end close on the last year’s file.</p>
