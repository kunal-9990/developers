        <h1>Built-in roles</h1>
        <p>CaseWare Cloud comes with several built-in roles. These roles define both the type of access and operations a user can perform in Cloud. There are two types of built-in roles: Staff roles and Contact roles.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> Built-in roles cannot be modified or deleted. Each organization has at least one user with the <i>Admin</i> user. This super user has the ability to modify organization settings and has permission for everything on the system.</p>
        <h2><a name="Staff_Roles"></a>Staff Roles</h2>
        <h3>Administrative Roles</h3>
        <p>These roles are assigned to staff and provide authoritative controls to shape and define an organization's Cloud environment - including its members. Administrative roles typically apply at the system level and cannot be assigned at the entity or item levels.</p>

        <p>These roles are assigned to staff and enable users to work and interact within a defined space (an entity) in Cloud. Staff roles apply at all object levels (system, entity, and item) enabling organizations to assign the same role for different user groups while maintaining control over access to content.</p>
