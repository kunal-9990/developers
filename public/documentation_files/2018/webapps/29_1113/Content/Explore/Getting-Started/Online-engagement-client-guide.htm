        <p>OnPoint PCR is a cloud-based solution for performing preparations, compilations, and reviews. Your accountant can give you client portal access to CaseWare Cloud so that you can collaborate on an OnPoint PCR engagement in real-time.</p>
        <h2 id="cloud-sign-in">How do I sign in to my accountant's portal?</h2>
        <p>When your accountant creates a user account for you, you will receive an email from CaseWare Cloud. This email notifies you that an account has been created for you, and it includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">a link to the portal</li>
            <li value="2">your user ID (your email address)</li>
            <li value="3">instructions on how to set up your password</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            <li value="2">Application security</li>
            <li value="3">Network security</li>
            <li value="4">Data security and privacy</li>

        <h2 id="respond-to-notifications">I just received a notification from my accountant. What do I do?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Select the link in the notification to launch your default web browser and open your accountant's sign-in page.</p>

                </p>
                <p>You will be directed to the page that your accountant has shared with you.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Complete the request based on the instructions that your accountant has provided.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="sign-documents">How do I sign things?</h2>
        <p>Currently, you must download documents to sign them. Once you have downloaded the document, you may sign it using your normal method.</p>
        <p>You can print the document, physically sign it, then scan it and upload it to Cloud or your online engagement.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, if you use a digital signature tool, you can use that to sign the electronic document.</p>
        <h2 id="upload-trial-balance">How do I upload my trial balance?</h2>
        <p>Your accountant will need to upload your trial balance data in order to work on your engagement. There are several ways to do this, depending on the financial software that you use.</p>
        <h3>Online accounting packages</h3>
        <p>If you are using an online bookkeeping system, you can provide your accountant with the appropriate access to that system. Once they have logged in, they can import your accounting data directly.</p>
        <h3>Excel or CSV</h3>
        <p>If you are providing an Excel trial balance, your accountant will likely use the collaboration tools built into the engagement to request your trial balance. They will send you an email that includes a link for you to upload your trial balance and other supporting documentation.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Select <b>View Details</b> to log in to the portal and view the request.</p>

        </p>
        <p>There are a few ways that you can upload the file:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">drag and drop the data file into the upload area</li>
            <li value="2">select the file to upload</li>
            <li value="3">copy a file that you have already uploaded to your accountant's file portal</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other desktop applications</h3>
        <p>Your accountant will likely work with you to extract the data into a format they can upload into their engagement file.</p>
