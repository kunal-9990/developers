        <h1>Login settings</h1>
        <p>When you first begin to set up your Cloud profile, you can configure Cloud settings for your organizationâ€™s security. As an administrator, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>
                Change the Cloud password settings</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>
                Set online session length</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Configure two-factor authentication</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="password-req">Set password requirements</h2>
        <p>Cloud has a default set of password requirements that are enforced for all new users. Once you have successfully logged into Cloud yourself, you can make these requirements more strict.</p>
        <p><b>To set password requirements:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Settings Admin</i> role or equivalent privileges.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Settings</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <b>Security | Password Settings</b>. The <b>Password Settings</b> page is displayed.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can set a minimum password strength and you can choose whether or not passwords will expire. Once you have set the password requirements, select <b>Save</b> to apply your changes.</p>
        <h3 id="password-req-minimum-strength">Minimum password strength</h3>
        <p>The minimum password strength is a setting that determines the minimum length for Cloud passwords and the different types of characters that must be included. Characters are grouped into four types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>lower-case letters</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>upper-case letters</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>numbers</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>non-alphanumeric characters</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The minimum password strength is <b>Moderate</b> by default, but you can set it to <b>Strong</b> or <b>Very Strong</b>. The stronger you require your Cloud passwords to be, the longer the passwords must be or the more different character types your users must include.</p>
        <p>For example, if you apply the <b>Moderate</b> setting, a staff member can use a password that is all lower-case letters if it is at least 12 characters long. If you apply the <b>Very Strong</b> setting, the same staff member can only use a password of all lower-case letters if the password is at least 30 characters long.</p>
        <h3 id="password-req-expiry">Password expiry</h3>
        <p>This password expiry setting lets you require staff members to periodically change their passwords. By default, passwords will never expire.</p>
        <p>To set up expiring passwords, choose <b>Yes</b> in the <b>Passwords expire</b> field. A new line is displayed where you can specify the number of months before passwords expire.</p>
        <h2 id="session-length">Set online session length</h2>
        <p>When a staff member signs in to Cloud, they begin a session. That staff member ends their session when they sign out from Cloud or when they close the application (in the web browser or in Working Papers).</p>
        <p>You can change this session management setting for all users in your organization. If you set Cloud to remember users on sign in, users will only have to log in once for a specified period of time. They will be able to close their browser without ending the session, and if they go back to Cloud in the same browser, they will automatically return to the last place they worked without needing to log in again.</p>
        <p><b>To set online session length:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Settings Admin</i> role or equivalent privileges.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Settings</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <b>Security | Session Management</b>. The <b>Session Management</b> page is displayed.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Select the checkbox for <b>Remember Users on Sign In</b>. A new line with a field for <b>Hours to Remember Users</b> is displayed.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Enter the number of hours that your organization's Cloud sessions should stay open after users close the application.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>Select <b>Save</b> to apply your changes.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once this setting is enabled, users for your organization will have the option to stay signed in for the number of hours that you entered in the settings.</p>
        <p>

        <h2 id="configure-2fa"><a name="Configur"></a>Configure two-factor authentication </h2>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> SMS-based two-factor authentication is currently available free of charge on a trial basis. In a future release, our development team will add a second method of two-factor authentication. That method will work with mobile devices, will not rely on SMS, and will be free to use.  When the second method becomes available, there may be additional costs for continued use of SMS-based two-factor authentication.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b> For staff members that integrated Working Papers with Cloud, two-factor authentication is only supported with Working Papers 2017.00.296 or later. An administrator must disable two-factor authentication for any staff members using an earlier version of Working Papers; otherwise, they will be unable to sign in.</p>
        <p class="bestpractice inline"><b>Best Practice:</b> Ensure that your organization has <b>at least two</b> staff members with the <i>Admin</i> role before enabling two-factor authentication. Only staff members with the <i>Admin</i> role can disable two-factor authentication. Having two users with the <i>Admin</i> role ensures that at least one account will always be able to access Cloud. You should also be sure to <a href="#Generate" class="MCXref xref">Generate backup codes </a> and keep them in a safe location.</p>
        <p>To effectively secure your organization's sensitive data, consider enabling two-factor authentication. With two-factor authentication, users will be expected to supply two pieces of information to verify their identity before gaining access to Cloud.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Your password</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>A single-use code sent to your mobile phone</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using two pieces of information helps ensure that you are the only person that can access your account, even if someone else has your password.</p>
        <h3 id="enable-2fa">Enable two-factor authentication across your organization</h3>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note</b>: Staff and contacts can always enable two-factor authentication from their own accounts. For more information on enabling two-factor authentication for individual users, see <a href="#Enable" class="MCXref xref">Enable two-factor authentication for your own account</a>.</p>
        <p>You can enable two-factor authentication for all staff and contacts from the Settings page. You can also enable two-factor authentication for your account individually. </p>
        <h4><a name="Addition"></a>Additional requirements for Working Papers users</h4>
        <p>Currently, two-factor authentication is only supported with Working Papers 2017.00.283 or later. If you are using an earlier version of Working Papers, an administrator must disable two-factor authentication for your Cloud account otherwise you will not be able to sign in.</p>

            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <b>All Staff</b>, <b>All Contacts</b>, or both. If you want either group to be able to opt out of two-factor authentication temporarily, <b>select Allow user to skip setup until:</b> and choose a date and time.
