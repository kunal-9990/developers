        <p>When you're ready to provide staff with accounts in Cloud, you can begin onboarding procedures. Generally, the procedures are the same for all organization sizes:&#160;</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Create groups based on functional roles and access rights.</p>
            </li>

            <li value="3">
                <p>Assign roles to each group or staff member to grant them access to Cloud.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bestpractice inline"><b>Best Practice:</b>&#160;For organizations with 10 or more people, it's generally better to assign roles to staff on an entity by entity basis. This ensures that staff only have access to client information that they'll need access to in order to complete their work. Assign system-wide roles sparingly to prevent users from having too much access to Cloud.</p>
        <h2 id="Create-user-groups">Create user groups</h2>
        <p>Before you begin to add staff or contacts, you can get started on your organization's framework by creating <b>groups</b>. Groups in Cloud are useful because you can control security settings and file access for multiple users at once. </p>
        <p>For example, if your organization has a large number of staff members, you could create groups for your engagement teams and could add staff members to each team that they are working on. This would enable partners or managers to share information or publish content specifically for the members of their teams without having to choose each team member individually.</p>
        <p><b>To create a new group:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Staff Admin</i> role or equivalent privileges.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>From the Cloud Menu, select <b>Groups</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <b>New</b>, then choose <b>Staff Group</b> or <b>Contacts Group</b>. The New Group dialog opens.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources/Images/Screenshots/New-group-795x447.png" alt="The Add Staff Group dialog" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Enter a <b>Name</b> and <b>Description</b> for your group.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>From the sidebar, select <b>Members</b>. Choose the users you want to add to this group.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>If you have the <i>Admin</i> role or equivalent permissions, you can also assign <b>System-Wide Roles</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="7">
                <p>Select <b>Save</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have successfully created a staff group and you have assigned your staff members to it. </p>
        <p>Once your staff members are set up on Cloud, you can give them access to client workspaces. In Cloud, these workspaces are called <b>entities</b>. For more information about granting access to client entities, see <a href="../../Setup/Users-and-Groups/Setting-staff-access-levels.htm">Setting staff access levels</a>.</p>
        <p>CaseWare Cloud offers two methods for adding staff or contacts to your organization: importing a list using a .csv file or delimited block of text or adding users individually in Cloud. If your organization has more than 50 employees or contacts, we recommend importing a user list.</p>
        <p>After your staff members and contacts are added to Cloud, you will need to configure their <b>system-wide</b>, <b>entity-wide</b> and <b>file-specific</b> roles as appropriate.</p>
        <h2 id="Preparing-a-user-list-for-import">Preparing a user list for import</h2>
        <p>Adding users from a list enables you to add a large number of users in a single procedure. The list file or text can add or modify users’ profile and contact information, as well as their group assignment. If an entered group does not exist in Cloud, importing the directory will create it.</p>
        <p>You’ll need a list of users in a <b>.csv file</b> or <b>delimited block of plain text</b>. </p>
        <p>When using either method, ensure that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Each row represents one user, and</li>
            <li value="2">Each column represents a property, such as their name, email, and user group. To include a user in more than one group, place a tilde (~) between each group name.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this example, an administrator wants to add four staff members to Cloud:</p>
        <p><i>Last Name, First Name, Email Address, Initials, Title, Phone Number, Group<br />Barnett, Betsy, betsy.barnett@peakstreak.com, BB, Senior, 416-555-5117 Ext: 128, G1<br />Henry, Isabel, isabel.henry@peakstreak.com, IH, Supervisor, 416-555-5117 Ext: 176, G1~G2<br />Holt, Ben, ben.holt@peakstreak.com, BH, Senior, 416-555-2115, G2<br />Nguyen, Nicholas, nicholas.nguyen@peakstreak.com, NN, Junior, 416-555-1956, G2</i>

        <p>If your organization is larger, you will require a more complex security policy. You may have one or more system administrators who will be responsible for Cloud's settings. Partners will still have access to almost all content, but managers and associates will be assigned to specific clients and engagements. These staff members will not need to be able to see all client entities.</p>
        <p><b>System admins</b> should have at least the following system-wide roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><i>Settings Admin</i>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><i>Staff Admin</i>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With these entitlements, your system admin can manage Cloud, and they can also create, modify, or delete other staff members. They cannot, however, view any of the content for clients of the organization or for other entities.</p>
        <p><b>Partners</b> should have at least the following system-wide roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><i>Staff Admin</i>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><i>Entities Admin</i>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With these entitlements, partners can create staff groups for <b>engagement teams</b>. Each engagement team should include a partner, a manager, and some number of associates.</p>
        <p>The partner can share the client entity with the new team, granting <i>Entity Access</i> to the group. The partner can then grant the <i>Owner</i> role for that entity to the manager.</p>
        <p>With the <i>Owner</i> role, the <b>manager</b> can add and share content for the current client engagement. They can decide whether new files should be shared with the whole engagement team or limited to specific team members. They can also review the time and expense entries for the client entity, and they can create invoices for their engagement.</p>
        <h3 id="Assign-firm-wide-roles">Assign system-wide roles</h3>
        <p>There are some security roles that you may want to apply to all content. For example, partners may need to have the ability to view all of the entities for your organization, and to edit or delete these entities on demand.</p>
        <p>You can grant this access by assigning system-wide security roles to users or groups.</p>
        <p><b>To assign system-wide roles to a user or group:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">

        <h3 id="Assign-client-wide-roles">Assign client-wide roles</h3>
        <p>In contrast to granting system-wide access, there may be some staff who should not be able to see everything in Cloud. You may grant a manager the ability to manage all content for a specific client, or you may want to only assign staff members to specific engagements so that they know that all activities on their Cloud timeline are relevant for their work assignments.</p>
        <p>You can grant this access by assigning client-wide access to users or groups.</p>

        <p>If the team members working on an engagement do not need to see each others’ documents or activities, you can assign security roles to your users for individual files.</p>
        <p>First, you need to grant your user the <i>Entity Access</i> role for the entity where these individual files will be added. This role permits users to see the entity in Cloud, but doesn’t grant any other access to the content under that entity.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: normal;">There is a <b>workflow</b> feature in Cloud that you can use to categorize entities, profiles, and files. For example, you might set up a workflow for your staff members called <b>Staff status</b> with stages such as <i>new</i>, <i>probation</i>, <i>full time</i>, and <i>temporary leave</i>. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">You may have already created this workflow when you were <a href="Setting-up-standards-and-workflows.htm">setting up your organizational standards</a>. Once a staff member workflow is in place, you can set the status for your new users. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To set the type of user:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Staff Admin</i> role or equivalent rights.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Staff</b> or <b>Contacts</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select the user whose workflow stage you want to change.</p>

                <p>In the user’s menu, select the current workflow, then select the new workflow option.</p>

        <h2>Welcome page</h2>
        <p>When your users log in for the first time, a Welcome page will open with links to key information about Cloud and how to use it. The Welcome page contains information to get your users up and running faster, with customized content for administrators, staff members and contacts.</p>
