        <p><b>Fusion RCT</b> is CaseWare’s solution for small and mid-sized Canadian firms to perform <b>Review</b>, <b>Compilation</b> and <b>Tax</b> engagements while taking advantage of CaseWare Cloud’s collaborative tools and single sourcing. It features detailed in-app guidance to direct you and your client contacts through each phase of the engagement. When you begin your engagement, your responses to checklist procedures, as well as the data you import, tailor the engagement, ensuring that team members and stakeholders are only shown content that is relevant to them.</p>
        <p>As you proceed through the engagement, you can assign tasks and document requests to client contacts and staff members, all without leaving the RCT interface.</p>
        <p>If you’re only using Fusion RCT to complete a corporate tax return, see <a href="Performing-a-Canadian-tax-engagement.htm" class="MCXref xref">Performing a Canadian tax engagement</a>.</p>
        <h2>Creating your engagement</h2>
        <p>To get started, create a new Fusion RCT engagement file. When you create your new engagement, you can also set key dates and budgets and assign staff members to the file to prepare and review the engagement work.</p>
        <p><b>To create a new Fusion RCT engagement:</b>
        </p>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Fusion RCT</b>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Select the <b>New</b> button.</li>
            <li value="2">In the Fusion RCT dialog, choose your client Entity, enter a name for the engagement file and specify the year of the engagement. You can also select a Start Date and End Date for your engagement and enter budget information.</li>
            <li value="3">In the Preparer field, enter your name and select yourself from the drop-down list. You are now assigned as the preparer.</li>
            <li value="4">In the Reviewer field, enter another staff member’s name. Select them from the list to assign them as a reviewer. </li>
            <li value="5">Select Save.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have created your new engagement, and you have assigned staff in the firm to prepare the engagement and to review it. When you select <b>Save</b>, the engagement file is automatically opened in your browser, assuming you have disabled your browser’s pop-up blocker.</p>
        <h3>Setting the Workflow status and Year-End Date</h3>
        <p>When you first open the engagement, a pop-up appears in the top-left displaying the engagement’s <b>Workflow status</b>. The Workflow status lets clients and other stakeholders know how far along in the engagement process you are. If you intend to start working on the engagement right away, set the Workflow status to <b>In Progress</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources/Images/Workflow-status-RCT.png" alt="Select your RCT engagement's Workflow status." />
        </p>
        <p>With the pop-up still open, set the engagement’s <b>Year-End Date</b>. Note that an incorrect year-end date will affect trial balance imports.</p>
        <p>Select <b>Save</b>. You will now see the engagement’s Documents page.</p>
        <h3>Viewing documents in Fusion RCT</h3>
        <p>The Documents page acts as Fusion RCT’s central hub. When you first open this page, very few documents are displayed -- that’s because you haven’t defined the parameters of the engagement yet. To populate the Documents page, you’ll need to complete the <b>0-10 Optimiser</b> checklist document. You can also view a list the engagement’s current documents at any time by opening the Documents list. Select the <b>folder icon</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources/Icons/SE icons/documents-sidebar-20x16.png" />) at the top left corner to display this list.</p>
        <p>You can open a document by selecting it from the list. If you know you’ll need to open a particular document frequently, you can pin it to the top of the list for quicker access by selecting the <b>pin icon</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources/Icons/SE icons/pin-icon-14x18.png" />) next to its name.</p>
        <p>Your engagement’s documents are divided into four phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Planning</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Performing</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Conclusion</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Tax</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each phase has its own progress indicator. These indicators reflect how many of the documents in the phase have been signed off on by a reviewer. For example, if two of eight Planning documents have been reviewed, the indicator will display the phase as 25% complete.</p>
        <p>To see all documents available in Fusion RCT, select <b>More Actions</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources/Icons/Ellipsis-20x16.png" style="font-weight: bold;" />) | <b>Hidden Items</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources/Images/View-RCT-documents.png" alt="Select Hidden Items to view all documents in Fusion RCT." />
        </p>
        <h2>Performing the engagement acceptance</h2>
        <p>Open the <b>0-10 Optimiser</b> document. The Optimiser contains a set of questions designed to determine the scope and nature of your engagement.</p>
        <p>The Optimiser is a checklist document. Every checklist contains a set of procedures that the engagement preparer can answer. Most of the engagement work in Fusion RCT engagements is completed in checklists.</p>
        <p>This document contains a <b>Notes</b> section, which details the purpose and scope of the document as it relates to regulatory standards.</p>
        <p>As you enter responses, further documents are added to the engagement. You can see these documents in the Documents list. The documents are grouped by phase, just as they are on the Documents page.</p>
        <p>Once you have completed the procedures, you can sign off on the document as either a Preparer or Reviewer by selecting <b>Sign Off</b> in the top-right corner of the document and selecting the appropriate role.</p>
        <h3>Notifying the document’s Reviewer</h3>
        <p>To notify the team member acting as Reviewer that the engagement acceptance document is ready for them to look at, create an Issue and assign it to them.</p>
        <p><b>To add an issue to a document</b>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>With the document open, select the <b>Issue</b> icon (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources/Icons/SE icons/Issue-icon.png" />).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Enter a message for the staff member and tag them by entering the at sign (@)  followed by their name. If they have access to the document, their name will  appear in the Quick List dialog.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select their name to tag them in the Issue’s description.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Select <b>To do</b> and choose the Issue type.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Select <b>Create Issue</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The new issue can be seen from within the document, on the Issues page, or on the Documents page.</p>
        <p>Once a document is signed off on, the progress indicator updates and the document is marked as completed on the Documents page.</p>
        <p>After completing this checklist, you’ll have a set of further acceptance/continuance documents to complete. The specific documents that make up this phase, as with the rest of the engagement, depend on your Optimiser responses. For example, let’s say that you specified that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>The legal structure of the entity is a corporation</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>This is not their first year of operations</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>You did perform their engagement last year</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>The compilation type is a Review</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given these responses, the following documents will make up the client acceptance/continuance phase:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>1-20 Existing engagement - Continuance, a checklist confirming your firm’s readiness and suitability to perform the engagement work.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>1-50 Review engagement letter, a letter document to be completed and given to your client to sign</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>1-55 Client queries - engagement letter, where your client will upload their signed copy of the engagement letter.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These documents will need to be completed in the order presented.</p>
        <h3>Editing the engagement letter</h3>
        <p>The draft version of your engagement letter is automatically generated based on your responses in the Optimiser checklist, as well as your firm’s Cloud Profile.</p>
        <p>At the top of the letter, you will see a guidance section containing information about the letter’s contents and instructions for finalizing the draft. Guidance is displayed by default, but is omitted when you print the letter. You can hide the guidance by selecting <b>More Actions</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources/Icons/Ellipsis-20x16.png" />) | <b>Off</b> or <b>Collapsed</b>.</p>
        <h3>Adding the firm letterhead</h3>
        <p>Indented text in square brackets indicates an area where you have to enter engagement-specific information. Review the letter and update any sections that contain placeholder text.</p>
        <p>For example, the first text area contains firm information. The firm name and address are added automatically using your firm profile on Cloud. The red text in this section should be replaced by your firm letterhead.</p>
        <p><b>To upload an image to a letter</b>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>With the letter document open, select <b>Edit</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources/Icons/SE icons/edit-icon-15x15.png" />).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select the text area where you want to place the image.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <b>Image</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources/Icons/SE icons/Image-icon.png" />) from the text editing toolbar.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Select <b>Choose File</b> to browse your computer for an image file.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>If required, select <b>Advanced</b> to set alternative text for the image and set custom dimensions. When you’re done, select <b>OK</b> to add the image to the letter.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have added the firm’s letterhead to your engagement letter.</p>
        <h3>Editing the letter contents</h3>
        <p>Fusion RCT comes preloaded with sample content, but you will most likely want to adjust the content to suit your needs. Select <b>Edit</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources/Icons/SE icons/edit-icon-18x18.png" />) to customize the letter’s content directly.</p>
        <p>You will find blue drop-down menus embedded in the letter. As with the indented text in brackets, these menus are placeholders for information that you need to specify.</p>
        <p>For example, in the first text area, you will see a pull-down menu that says <b>Today’s Date</b>. Select the appropriate date from the calendar pop-up to enter it into the letter.</p>
        <p>When you’re satisfied with the contents of the engagement letter, perform the appropriate <b>Sign Off</b>. Once the content is reviewed, you’re ready to send a copy to your client.</p>
        <h3>Send the engagement letter to the client for review and signing</h3>
        <p>You need the client’s signature on the engagement letter in order to proceed with the engagement. You can send your draft directly to your client using Fusion RCT with a query. Queries are procedures used to communicate directly with the client. There are three types of query documents:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Request for information - send questions to the client.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Document request - ask the client to upload one or more files.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Send deliverables - send documents to the client to sign and return.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your client has a contact account in Cloud, they can sign in and respond to queries directly. Open the Documents page. In the <b>Perform the client acceptance/continuance</b> phase and open the <b>1-55 Client queries - engagement letter</b> document.</p>
        <p>In the top-right corner of the document, change the Query’s status to <b>Open</b>. An <b>Open Query</b> pop-up will open. Select a <b>Due Date</b>, specify the contacts assigned to the engagement (or simply assign it to all contacts associated with the entity), and enter an appropriate email message.</p>
        <p>Select <b>OK</b> to send out the request. The contact will receive an email with your message and a link to the engagement.</p>
        <p>When they open the query document, they can select the draft document to download a PDF, sign it on their end, and upload the signed document by clicking and dragging it to the upload area, selecting it from their hard drive, or copying it from elsewhere in Cloud.</p>
        <p>With your engagement letter drafted, signed, and uploaded to the engagement, you’re ready to proceed with your engagement work.</p>
        <h2>Completing the Planning phase</h2>
        <p>The final section of the Planning phase of the engagement, <b>Plan the engagement</b>, contains the documents where you request detailed information about the client firm’s business and, if necessary, perform the engagement scoping. Assign any query documents to the appropriate client contact and perform sign-off and review, as with the engagement letter query.</p>
        <p>This section also contains the Materiality and Scoping documents, both required elements of the standard Review workflow. For more details on using the Materiality document, see <a href="../../Engagements/Planning/Defining-materiality.htm" class="MCXref xref">Defining materiality </a>.</p>
        <h2>Completing the Performing phase</h2>
        <p>If you’re performing a Review, you’ll need to present and substantiate your analysis of the trial balance and any other applicable data sources in the Performing phase. As with the other phases, the documents that will need to be completed will differ depending on your Optimiser responses. This phase contains checklist documents and, if you enabled them, Worksheets designed to streamline specific areas of your engagement. For example, the <b>3-94 Worksheet - Sales tax reasonability</b> helps you to determine if the engagement data contains sufficient information to assess the reasonableness of GST/HST amounts receivable or payable.</p>
        <p>Ensure that all appropriate documents in the Performing phase are prepared and reviewed by staff members.</p>
        <h3>Building the financial statements</h3>
        <p>If you’re compiling financial statements as part of your engagement, you’ll need to import your client’s data using either an exported CSV file or another accounting service. After you import the data, you can customize the financial statements to suit the scope of the engagement.</p>
        <h3>Importing the client’s trial balance</h3>
        <p>Fusion RCT enables you to import trial balance and transaction data from a wide variety of sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>CaseWare Working Papers engagement files</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>CSV (Excel) files</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Over 75 desktop accounting software packages</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Online accounting services</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The process for importing trial balance data differs depending on what software you’re importing data from. For some imports, you may need to assign accounts from the source data to the Fusion RCT configuration manually. For instructions, see <a href="../../Engagements/File-Preparation/Import-clients-financial-data-to-an-engagement-file.htm" class="MCXref xref">Import client's financial data to an engagement file</a>.</p>
        <p>After you’ve imported the trial balance, you may have to post adjustments or make other changes. For more on working with your imported trial balance, see Posting adjustments to the trial balance and Adding an account or group to the trial balance.</p>
        <h2>Completing the engagement</h2>
        <p>The documents you’ll need to complete your Review or compilation engagement work are found in the Conclusion phase. Each engagement type has its own completion checklist document intended to verify that the firm has satisfied the terms of the engagement. For Compilation engagements, this is <b>5-10 Completion </b>checklist; for Review engagements, this is <b>310 Compilation engagement - Planning and completion</b> checklist. Depending on the engagement type and your Optimiser responses, this phase may also contain Worksheets and letter documents to complete.</p>
        <p>This phase also contains the Financial statements, if you indicated that they will need to be compiled as part of your engagement work. Review the statements for accuracy and design. You can edit the statement contents, including the ability to override existing values, add groups and rows, add or remove notes, and more. For more on working with, editing, and printing financial statements, see Preparing financial statements.</p>
        <h3>Final steps</h3>
        <p>If you’ve prepared financial statements, you’ll need to complete the <b>6-10 Report transmittal</b> checklist to specify the parties that will receive a copy of your findings, as well as any specialized instructions.</p>
        <p>The document also contains signature fields for multiple parties from your firm that will need to be filled in order to confirm that each major area of the engagement has been completed to your staff’s satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Once this document is completed and signed off on, you may want to download a Reference Copy of the engagement to send to the client or for your own records. This consists of a .zip file containing PDF copies of all the engagement’s documents. To do this, select <b>Information</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources/Icons/SE icons/information-icon-menu-15x15.png" />) | <b>Download reference copy</b>.</p>
        <p>Once all work on the engagement has been completed, you can Lock the file to prevent any further changes. To lock down the file, select <b>Lockdown</b> from the engagement menu.</p>
