        <h1>Performing a Canadian tax engagement</h1>
        <p><b>Fusion RCT</b> (RCT) lets you perform a complete corporate tax return directly from CaseWare Cloud. In addition to all standard federal and provincial forms, RCT contains Workcharts specifically designed to streamline the process of completing the return. RCT was designed and developed in partnership with the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) to ensure compliance, and links up with the CRA’s <b>Autofill</b> service to import up to five prior years’ tax data. When you’ve completed the return, you can access the CRA’s <b>EFILE</b> service from the RCT interface, or you can print a hard copy for the client to review and file themselves.</p>
        <h2>Creating your engagement</h2>
        <p>To get started, create a new Fusion RCT engagement file. When you create your new engagement, you can also set key dates and budgets and assign staff members to the file to prepare and review the engagement work.</p>
        <p><b>To create a new Fusion RCT engagement:</b>
        </p>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Fusion RCT</b>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Select the <b>New</b> button.</li>
            <li value="2">In the Fusion RCT dialog, choose your client Entity, enter a name for the engagement file and specify the year of the engagement. You can also select a Start Date and End Date for your engagement and enter budget information.</li>
            <li value="3">In the Preparer field, enter your name and select yourself from the drop-down list. You are now assigned as the preparer.</li>
            <li value="4">In the Reviewer field, enter another staff member’s name. Select them from the list to assign them as a reviewer. </li>
            <li value="5">Select Save.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have created your new engagement, and you have assigned staff in the firm to prepare the engagement and to review it. When you select <b>Save</b>, the engagement file is automatically opened in your browser, assuming you have disabled your browser’s pop-up blocker.</p>
        <h3>Setting the Workflow status and Year-End Date</h3>
        <p>When you first open the engagement, a pop-up appears in the top-left displaying the engagement’s <b>Workflow status</b>. The Workflow status lets clients and other stakeholders know how far along in the engagement process you are. If you intend to start working on the engagement right away, set the Workflow status to <b>In Progress</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Workflow-status-RCT.png" alt="Select your RCT engagement's Workflow status." />
        </p>
        <p>With the pop-up still open, set the engagement’s <b>Year-End Date</b>. Note that an incorrect year-end date will affect trial balance imports.</p>
        <p>Select <b>Save</b>. You will now see the engagement’s Documents page.</p>
        <h2>Setting up your tax engagement</h2>
        <p>To enable RCT’s tax features, you’ll need to complete certain procedures on the <b>0-10 Optimiser</b> checklist. If you only want to perform a corporate tax return,  select <b>Corporation Tax only</b> as the type of engagement being performed. If you want to perform a review or compilation engagement along with the tax return, select <b>Review and Corporation Tax</b> or <b>Compilation and Corporation Tax</b> as appropriate.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Optimiser-engagement-type.png" alt="Select your Engagement type in the Optimiser checklist." />
        </p>
        <p>Complete the rest of the checklist as appropriate.</p>
        <p>For more on Review and Compilation engagements, see <a href="Performing-an-engagement-in-Fusion-RCT.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Performing an engagement in Fusion RCT</a>.</p>
        <h3>Completing the Tax optimiser checklist</h3>
        <p>Return to the Documents page and select the <b>T-01 TOC - Tax optimiser checklist</b> document. As with the first Optimiser checklist, your responses will determine the documents that will make up your Tax engagement. Some responses will be automatically pulled from your firm's Cloud Profile. Complete the procedures and perform sign-off on the document.</p>
        <h3>Customizing the engagement letter</h3>
        <p>RCT contains a standard engagement letter for outlining the engagement parameters with your client. To customize the letter’s contents, select <b>Edit</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/edit-icon-15x15.png" />) and either edit the pre-existing content, or just paste in your firm’s preferred content. When you’re done, select the appropriate Sign Off status. You can print the letter to PDF or hard copy by selecting <b>Print</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/Print-icon.png" />).</p>
        <h3>Importing tax data</h3>
        <p>If your firm has already imported the client’s trial balance data as part of a Compilation or Review engagement for this client, the data will already be available for use in your tax forms. Otherwise, you’ll need to perform the import yourself.</p>
        <p>RCT offers a variety of options for importing client data. You can access all import options from within any Tax form by selecting <b>Import</b>.</p>
        <h4>Importing from GIFI</h4>
        <p>Select this option if you have a file in .GFI format containing the client’s GIFI data. Select <b>GIFI</b>, then browse for the .GFI file on your computer and select <b>Open</b>.</p>
        <h4>Importing from TaxPrep</h4>
        <p>Select this option if you have a .CSV format output file exported from TaxPrep. If you’re unsure how to export a .CSV file from TaxPrep, follow the instructions below.</p>
        <p><b>To export a .CSV file from TaxPrep:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Open the client file in TaxPrep.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Perform a Roll Forward.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <b>File | Export Tax Return...</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Make sure the File Type is set to <b>.csv</b>, then select <b>OK</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Enter a file name and path, then select <b>Save</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In your open RCT tax document, select <b>Import | TaxPrep CSV</b> and browse for the exported file. Select <b>Open</b> to perform the import.</p>
        <h4>Importing from the CRA</h4>
        <p>If your client is registered for the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA)'s T2 Auto-fill program, you can import the engagement's tax data automatically based on the client's previously filed returns.</p>
        <p><b>To transfer tax engagement data from the CRA:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>In any open CRT Tax document, select <b>Import | T2 Auto-fill</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select <b>Yes</b> in the prompt that follows.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>The CRA website opens in a new browser tab. Log into your CRA account using your credentials. On the request confirmation page, select <b>Next</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Select the data types you want to import into your engagement, then select <b>Download</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>You will be asked to compare the values from the CRA against the existing values that have already been entered for the fields, if any. The CRA values are displayed in the left column, while the engagement's current values are displayed on the right. For each line, select the checkbox on the right to use the CRA value. To use the CRA values for all lines, select the large checkbox at the top of the modal. When you're done, select <b>Transfer</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>The values are transferred to your engagement and a confirmation modal is displayed. Select <b>5 Year History</b> to review the historical data, or select Close.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The CRA-provided data is imported into your engagement.</p>
        <h4>Importing from CaseWare Working Papers</h4>
        <p>CloudBridge is an add-on for CaseWare Working Papers that lets you link a Working Papers engagement file to a Cloud entity to import your engagement's trial balance and GIFI data into your RCT engagement. </p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note</b>: This procedure requires a Working Papers engagement file. Your copy of Working Papers must also be integrated with your Cloud firm. For more about syncing Working Papers to Cloud, see our <a href="https://www.caseware.com/ca/support/working-papers">Working Papers help</a>.</p>
        <p><b>To create a link to CloudBridge in Working Papers</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Open the CloudBridge installation package and follow the steps in the installation wizard.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Open your client file in CaseWare Working Papers.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>From the <b>Document</b> tab, click <b>From Library | CloudBridge</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>The <b>Document Library</b> dialog displays. Select <b>CLBG</b> and click <b>Add</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The CLBG (CloudBridge) document displays at the top of the Document Manager.</p>
        <p>This will open CloudBridge in your Working Papers browser. Follow the instructions in CloudBridge to transfer the data. You will have the option to export GIFI data, Trial Balance data, or both, as well as the option to associate specific GL accounts with appropriate RCT Workcharts.</p>
        <h3>Completing the tax forms</h3>
        <p>With your client’s data now populating your RCT engagement forms, you can begin the actual tax engagement work. Start by completing the Tax Preparer Profile document, which requires you to enter detailed information about your firm. Some fields will be automatically filled if your firm has completed its Cloud firm profile.</p>
        <p>Since you completed the Tax Optimiser document, RCT will only list the documents that are relevant to your tax engagement.  To see all forms available in RCT, select <b>More Actions</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/Ellipsis-20x16.png" />) <b>| Hidden Items</b>, or open the <b>Tax Forms List</b> document.</p>
        <p>Your Optimiser selections determine which workcharts, if any, are added to the Documents list. Workcharts are documents designed to streamline your engagement work.</p>
        <h3>Navigating between documents</h3>
        <p>Fusion RCT  makes it easy to navigate between workcharts and their related schedules as you complete the return. The RCT interface offers two options for moving between these documents.</p>
        <h4>Jump To Source</h4>
        <p>When you select a field that has a single source, you will see this dialog:</p>
        <p>When you select Jump To Source,  the source document opens and “jumps” directly to the appropriate line, with the source field highlighted in flashing blue.</p>
        <h4>Viewer</h4>
        <p>In documents where an entire row of data is derived from one specific source document, you’ll see a Viewer icon () to the right of the row. This feature opens the linked document in a pop-up display without opening a new browser window or tab. For example, each class listed in the S8 - Capital Class Allocation document is linked to its corresponding page from the CCA Worksheet.</p>
        <h3>Correcting errors with your return</h3>
        <p>If there are any outstanding issues with your return, you will be unable to file it. Open the <b>DIAG - Diagnostics Workchart</b> document to view the engagement's outstanding issues. Select <b>E-File Diagnostics</b> to filter the list of issues to only display those that will prevent a successful electronic filing.</p>
        <p>To fix a specific issue, select it, then select <b>Jump To</b>. RCT opens the relevant document and "jumps" to the line containing the error.</p>
        <p>Once all issues have been addressed, you’re ready to file your client’s corporate tax return.</p>
        <h3>Filing or printing the tax return</h3>
        <p>Fusion RCT lets you file the completed return to the CRA, assuming you have the appropriate credentials already set up. Alternatively, you can export the return as a PDF file and then either share it electronically or print a hard copy.</p>
        <h4>Filing the return via EFILE</h4>
        <p>With the tax data imported, the engagement work complete, and all outstanding issues fixed, you can begin your electronic filing via the CRA's EFILE program. Select <b>EFILE</b> from the top menu to open the Efile information page.</p>
        <p>From this page, you can file your return to the CRA via one of two sets of credentials. If your firm is a Certified Tax Preparer, you can enter your <b>CRA Login Information</b>. Alternatively, you can enter a <b>WACode (Web Access Code)</b> provided by the client.</p>
        <p>If you require a Web Access Code and have not yet been provided with one, select <b>WAC - Web Access Code Online Request</b> and complete the request form.</p>
        <h4>Printing a hard copy of the return</h4>
        <p>If your client requests a copy of the return for their records, you can create a PDF file directly from Fusion RCT, which can then be saved to disk and shared with the client electronically, or printed as a hard copy</p>
        <p>Select <b>Print</b> from any open tax document to select the document or return you want to print.</p>
