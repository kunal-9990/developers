                <p>This feature is only available with OnPoint PCR.</p>
                <p><a href="../Products/OnPoint-PCR.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">OnPoint PCR — Preparation, Compilation and Reviews</a>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p><b>OnPoint PCR</b> is CaseWare’s solution for small and mid-sized US firms to perform <b>Preparation</b>, <b>Compilation</b>, and <b>Review</b> engagements while taking advantage of CaseWare Cloud’s collaborative tools and single sourcing. It features detailed in-app guidance to direct you through each step of the engagement. When you begin your engagement, your responses to checklist procedures will determine the engagement’s scope, ensuring that team members and stakeholders are only shown content that is relevant to them.</p>
        <h2>Creating your engagement</h2>
        <p>To begin, create a new OnPoint PCR engagement file. In CaseWare Cloud, you can create your engagement file in the client entity. You can also set key dates and budgets and assign staff members to the file.</p>
        <p><b>To create a new OnPoint PCR engagement</b>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>OnPoint PCR</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select the <b>New</b> button.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>In the OnPoint PCR dialog, choose your client <b>Entity</b> and enter a name for the engagement file. You can also set a <b>Start Date</b> and <b>End Date</b> for your engagement and enter budget information.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>In the <b>Preparer</b> field, enter your name and select yourself from the drop-down list. You are now assigned as the preparer.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>In the <b>Reviewer</b> field, enter another staff member’s name. Select their account to assign them as a reviewer.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>At the bottom of the OnPoint PCR dialog, select <b>Save</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have created your new engagement, and you have assigned staff in the firm to prepare the engagement and to review it. When you select <b>Save</b>, the engagement file is automatically opened in your browser, assuming you have disabled your browser’s pop-up blocker.</p>
        <h2>Setting the Workflow status and Year-End Date</h2>
        <p>When you first open the engagement, a pop-up appears in the top-left displaying the engagement’s <b>Workflow status</b>. The Workflow status lets clients and other stakeholders know how far along in the engagement process you are. If you intend to start working on the engagement right away, set the Workflow status to <b>In Progress</b>.</p>
        <p>With the pop-up still open, set the engagement’s <b>Year-End Date</b>. Note that an incorrect year-end date will affect trial balance imports.</p>
        <p>Select <b>Save</b>. You will now see the engagement’s Documents page.</p>
        <h2>Viewing documents in OnPoint PCR</h2>
        <p>The Documents page acts as <b>OnPoint PCR</b>’s central hub. When you first open this page, very few documents are displayed -- that’s because you haven’t defined the parameters of the engagement yet. To populate the Documents page, you’ll need to complete the <b>1-110 Engagement Acceptance and Continuance</b> document, which you can find in the Engagement Acceptance and Planning phase. You can also view a list the engagement’s current documents at any time by opening the <b>Documents list</b>. Select the <b>folder</b> icon (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Icons/SE icons/documents-sidebar-19x15.png" />) at the top left corner to display this list.</p>
        <p>You can open a document by selecting it from the list. If you know you’ll need to open a particular document frequently, you can <b>pin</b> it to the top of the list for quicker access by selecting the <b>pin</b> icon (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Icons/SE icons/pin-icon-14x18.png" />) next to its name.</p>
        <p>Your engagement’s documents are divided into four phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Client Acceptance and Planning</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Fieldwork</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Financial Statements and Wrap-up</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Permanent File</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first three of these phases have progress indicators. These indicators  reflect how many of the documents in the phase have been signed off on by a reviewer. In the Permanent File phase, you can add supporting documents. These documents will be carried forward when you create next year’s engagement for this client.</p>
        <p>If you want to see all documents available in OnPoint PCR, select <b>More Actions</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Icons/Ellipsis-20x16.png" />) <b>| Hidden Items</b>.</p>
        <h2>Performing the engagement acceptance</h2>
        <p>Open the <b>1-110 Engagement Acceptance and Continuance</b> document. This document contains a set of questions designed to determine the scope and nature of your engagement.</p>
        <p>This document is a <b>checklist</b> document. Every checklist contains a set of procedures that the engagement preparer can answer. Most of the engagement work in OnPoint PCR engagements is completed in checklists.</p>
        <p>This document contains a Guidance section, which details the purpose and scope of the document as it relates to regulatory standards. Additionally, some individual procedures have their own guidance text, as indicated by a <b>lightbulb</b> icon (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Icons/SE icons/guidance-white-12x16.png" />).</p>
        <p>As you enter responses, further documents are added to the engagement. You can see these documents in the Documents list. In this list  documents are grouped by phase, just as they are on the Documents page.</p>
        <p>Once you have completed the procedures, you can sign off on the document as either a <b>Preparer</b> or <b>Reviewer</b> by selecting <b>Sign Off</b> in the top-right corner of the document and selecting the appropriate role.</p>
        <h3>Notifying the document’s Reviewer</h3>
        <p>To notify the team member acting as Reviewer that the engagement acceptance document is ready for them to look at, create an Issue and assign it to them.</p>
        <p><b>To add an issue to a document</b>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>With the document open, select the <b>Issue</b> icon (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Icons/SE icons/Issue-icon.png" />).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Enter a message for the staff member and tag them by entering the at sign (@)  followed by their name. If they have access to the document, their name will  appear in the Quick List dialog.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select their name to tag them in the Issue’s description.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Select <b>To do</b> and choose the Issue type.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Select <b>Create Issue</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The new issue can be seen from within the document, on the Issues page, or on the Documents page.</p>
        <p>Once all issues have been resolved and the Engagement Acceptance document is signed off on, the completion level is updated and the document is marked as completed on the Documents page.</p>
        <p>After completing this checklist, you’ll have an additional engagement acceptance checklist to complete, based on which engagement type you selected. For example, if you selected <b>Preparation</b> as the engagement type, you’ll need to complete the <b>1-115 Preparation Engagement Quality Acceptance and Conclusion</b> checklist.</p>
        <p>These checklists conclude with a procedure to confirm that your firm is capable of completing the engagement work and that no significant ethical concerns or operational limitations need to be addressed.</p>
        <p>You can now view and edit the draft <b>engagement letter</b>.</p>
        <h2>Editing the engagement letter</h2>
        <p>The first two checklist documents that you have completed outline the basic engagement information. The draft version of your engagement letter is automatically generated based on your responses in those checklists.</p>
        <p>At the top of the letter, you will see a guidance section containing information about the letter’s contents and instructions for finalizing the draft. Guidance is displayed by default, but is omitted when you print the letter.</p>
        <h3>Adding the firm letterhead</h3>
        <p>Red text indicates an area where you have to enter engagement-specific information. Review the letter and update any sections that contain placeholder text.</p>
        <p>For example, the first text area contains firm information. The firm name and address are added automatically using your firm profile on Cloud. The red text in this section should be replaced by your firm letterhead.</p>
        <p><b>To upload an image to a letter</b>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>With the letter document open, select <b>Edit</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Icons/SE icons/edit-icon-15x15.png" />).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select the text area where you want to place the image.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <b>Image</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Icons/SE icons/Image-icon.png" />) from the text editing toolbar.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Select <b>Choose File</b> to browse your computer for an image file.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>If required, select <b>Advanced</b> to set alternative text for the image and set custom dimensions. When you’re done, select <b>OK</b> to add the image to the letter.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have added the firm’s letterhead to your engagement letter.</p>
        <h3>Editing the letter contents</h3>
        <p>OnPoint PCR comes preloaded with sample content, but you will most likely want to adjust the content to suit your needs. Select <b>Edit</b> to customize the letter’s content directly.</p>
        <p>You will find blue drop-down menus embedded in the letter. Like red text, these menus are placeholders for information that you need to add.</p>
        <p>For example, in the first text area, you will see a pull-down menu that says Today’s Date. Select the appropriate date from the calendar pop-up to enter it into the letter.</p>
        <p>Throughout the engagement letter, you will also see text highlighted in grey. This is dynamic text, meaning that the text changes based on specific checklist responses. For example, if you select balance sheet from the first sentence, a pop-up will display the different conditions and the display text associated with them.</p>
        <p>When you’re satisfied with the contents of the engagement letter, perform the appropriate Sign Off. Once the content is reviewed, you’re ready to send a copy to your client.</p>
        <p>Send the engagement letter to the client for review and signing</p>
        <h3>Send the engagement letter to the client for review and signing</h3>
        <p>You need the client’s signature on the engagement letter in order to proceed with the engagement. You can send your draft directly to your client using OnPoint PCR with a query. Queries are procedures used to communicate directly with the client. There are three types of query documents:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Request for information - send questions to the client.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Document request - ask the client to upload one or more files.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Send deliverables - send documents to the client to sign and return.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your client has a contact account in Cloud, they can sign in and respond to queries directly. Open the Documents page. In the Client Acceptance and Planning phase, under the Draft engagement letter, open the query document ending with (Query to Client).</p>
        <p>In the top-right corner, change the Query’s status to <b>Open</b>. An Open Query pop-up will open. Select a Due Date, specify the contacts assigned to the engagement, and enter an appropriate email message.</p>
        <p>Select <b>OK</b> to send the request to your contacts. They’ll receive an email with your message and a link to the engagement.</p>
        <p>When they open the query document, they can select the draft document to download a PDF, sign it on their end, and upload the signed document by clicking and dragging it to the upload area, selecting it from their hard drive, or copying it from elsewhere in Cloud.</p>
        <p>With your engagement letter drafted, signed, and uploaded to the engagement, you’re ready to proceed with your engagement work.</p>
        <h3>Requesting documents from your client</h3>
        <p>On the Documents page, in the Engagement Acceptance and Planning phase, you’ll see a PBC requests subsection. This subsection contains query documents. The exact name of the query document you need to start with will depend on your Optimizer responses; for example, if you specified that this is not your first engagement with the client, <b>2-930 PBC Document Requests - Engagements Subsequent to Initial Year</b> will display.</p>
        <p>This query document includes a list of file requests for files and information that could be relevant for a review engagement.</p>
        <p>Since there may be documents not relevant for this client or engagement, you can edit the query to make it more manageable. At the top of the document, select the <b>Edit</b> icon to enable editing.</p>
        <h3>Importing the client’s trial balance</h3>
        <p>OnPoint PCR enables you to import trial balance and transaction data from a wide variety of sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>CaseWare Working Papers engagement files</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>CSV (Excel) files</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Over 75 desktop accounting software packages</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Online accounting services</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The process for importing trial balance data differs depending on what software you’re importing data from. For some imports, you may need to assign accounts from the source data to the OnPoint PCR configuration manually. For instructions, see <a href="../../Engagements/File-Preparation/Import-clients-financial-data-to-an-engagement-file.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Import client's financial data to an engagement file</a>.</p>
        <p>After you’ve imported the trial balance, you may have to post adjustments or make other changes. For more on working with your imported trial balance, see Posting adjustments to the trial balance and Adding an account or group to the trial balance.</p>
        <h2>Performing fieldwork</h2>
        <p>If you’re performing a Review, you’ll need to present and substantiate your analysis of the trial balance and any other applicable data sources in the Fieldwork phase. As with the other phases, the documents that will need to be completed will differ depending on your Optimiser responses. Start with the 2-100 Review - Overall Analysis document to set the parameters of your review, then complete the remaining documents in the phase.</p>
        <h2>Completing the engagement</h2>
        <p>The documents you’ll need to complete your engagement work are found in the Financial Statements and Wrap-up phase of the Documents page. Each engagement type has its own Wrap-up checklist, confirming that your firm has performed its due diligence in accordance with the needs of the reporting framework. These checklists will need to be completed and signed off on.</p>
        <p>If you’re performing a Review or Compilation, you’ll also need to complete the Disclosure Checklist Optimizer document. As with the previous Optimizers, your responses will determine which disclosure checklists will appear in the Documents page. Complete and sign off on this document, then complete the newly added checklists.</p>
        <p>This phase also contains the Financial statements. Review the statements for accuracy and design. You can edit the statement contents, including the ability to override existing values, add groups and rows, add or remove notes, and more. For more on working with financial statements, see <a href="../../Engagements/Statements-and-Conclusions/Preparing-financial-statements.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Preparing financial statements </a>.</p>
        <h3>Printing the financial statements</h3>
        <p>When the statements are ready, you can print them to PDF and, if you like, a hard copy. First, you’ll need to adjust the print settings to suit your engagement requirements.</p>
        <p>To modify the print settings:</p>
        <p>In the document toolbar, select the more actions button, then select <b>Print Settings</b>.</p>
        <p>The Print Settings dialog is displayed.</p>
        <p>In this dialog, you can change the following settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Header and Footer - enter content for headers and footers when you print your document.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Page Settings - select a page size and toggle page orientation between portrait (default) and landscape.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Margins - set the margins for your document.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Table of Contents Settings - select whether the pages should be counted when generating the table of contents.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note</b>: This setting only applies when changing print settings for a Page Break or Grouping section.</p>
        <p>Select <b>Save</b> to configure the print job.</p>
        <p>With the Statements open, select <b>Print</b> to generate a PDF copy of the Financial Statements. This automatically opens a new tab in your browser window, displaying the PDF version of the statements. You can choose to save the file locally as a PDF, or you can select the Change button and find a local printer to print a physical copy.</p>
        <h3>Reviewing and submitting the Representation letter</h3>
        <p>The last step in your engagement is to draft and submit your representation letter along with your findings. This letter attests that you and your team have satisfied the terms of the engagement and worked within regulatory constraints. As with the other letter documents, your previous checklist responses will help shape the draft content. Edit the document as needed and assign it for review.</p>
        <p>Once the letter has been downloaded and signed, your client contact can upload it from the Documents page by selecting <b>3-160c Representation Letter (Signed)</b> and locating the file on their hard drive or from CaseWare Cloud.</p>
