        <p>As the reviewer, you will be reviewing the fieldwork done by the preparer in an engagement file. You can identify the documents that need to be reviewed and work with the preparer on CaseWare Cloud.</p>
        <h2 id="Check-the-engagement-for-prepared-documents">Check the engagement for prepared documents</h2>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Engagements</b> to open the Engagements page. When you open the page, your default view on the Engagements menu is <b>My Work</b>, and any engagements that you have been assigned a role on are displayed.</p>
        <p>Select an engagement to expand the details. Under <b>Document Status</b>, you can see a breakdown of the status of all the documents in the engagement file. If you see that there are <b>Prepared</b> documents in the file, this means that the preparer has signed off on documents, and they are now ready for review.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/Engagements/Images/engagements-document-status-prepared-1303x843.png" alt="There are two documents in this engagement that have been signed off by the preparer." />
        </p>
        <h2 id="Review-prepared-documents">Review prepared documents</h2>
        <p>If your engagement does have prepared documents, you can open the engagement to begin your review.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/Engagements/Images/engagements-document-status-prepared-open-engagement-1303x460.png" alt="Select Open at the top of the engagement details section." />
        </p>
        <p>On the Documents page, each document is displayed with a sign-off icon. Documents that are ready for review will have the <b>Prepared sign off icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/sign-off-icons-prepared-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) in front of their name.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Open a prepared document to begin your review.</p>
        <h2 id="Create-a-review-note">Create a review note</h2>
        <p>In the document, you will be able to see all of the selections the preparer made and the information that they entered. If you notice a problem with the document, you can add a review note for the preparer.</p>
        <p>A review note is a type of <b>Issue</b> that you can create in your engagement file. You can create review notes for specific areas of the document.</p>
        <p><b>To add a review note to a specific area of a document:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>At the end of the line for the document area, select the <b>Add Issue</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/note-add-inline-17x15.png" />).</p>

            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>In the Issue editor, enter a description for your review note.</p>

                <p>Select <b>Create Issue</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have created a new review note for the engagement preparer, and the note is displayed at the area of the document that needs to be reassessed or corrected. When the preparer opens the document, the Issue icon will indicate that there is one issue for this line. The preparer can select the icon to see your note. They can also reply to the note if they have any comments or questions about the issue.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/SmartEngagement/Images/documents-optimizer-reviewer-add-note-result-1134x640.png" alt="The preparer can easily see your note in the problem area of the document, and they can take steps to fix the problem." />
        </p>
        <h2 id="Clear-a-resolved-review-note">Clear a resolved review note</h2>
        <p>Once a preparer has seen a review note and has corrected the problem you identified, they will change the issue status to <b>Resolved</b>. When an issue has been resolved, the Issues icon will still be displayed in the proper area of the document, but there will no longer be a number inside the icon.</p>
        <p>You can select the issue icon to see any additional details about the resolution. If you are satisfied with the changes that the preparer has made, you can clear the resolved issue. </p>
        <p><b>To clear a review note:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Select the <b>Issue</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/note-add-inline-17x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>On the Issue pop-up, select <b>Clear</b>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/SmartEngagement/Images/issue-popup-clear-resolved-700x480.png" alt="Select Clear at the bottom of the Issue pop-up." />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have cleared the resolved issue. The Issue icon in the document will no longer have the solid black outline that indicates an issue, but you can still see cleared issues in the engagement by going to the Issues page. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/SmartEngagement/Images/issue-summary-page-review-cleared-issue-1134x571.png" alt="You can access the Issues summary page by selecting Issues on the engagement menu at the top of the page." />
        </p>
        <h2 id="Sign-off-on-a-document">Sign off on a document</h2>
        <p>Once you have reviewed a document and you have determined that the content is correct, you can sign off on the document to indicate that it is complete.</p>
        <p><b>To sign off on a document:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>At the top of the document, select the Sign Off drop-down menu. The sign-off roles are displayed. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/SmartEngagement/Images/documents-optimizer-sign-off-reviewer-role-1134x290.png" alt="You will see who signed off on the Preparer role and when the document was signed off." />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select <b>Sign off</b> beside the role you want to sign off on.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you sign off on the review, the document status is updated. Your name and the date are recorded in the document, and when you go to the Documents page, you will see that the icon now indicates that the document has been reviewed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/SmartEngagement/Images/documents-optimizer-document-page-reviewed-result-1134x370.png" alt="The Optimizer document now has an icon indicating that it has been reviewed." />
        </p>
        <p>Your engagement is one step closer to being complete. You can see a measure of this completion progress at the top of the section on the Documents page. A small icon displays what percentage of the documents in the section have been reviewed.</p>
