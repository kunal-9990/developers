        <p>While working on your file, you will complete many work programs, create letters, and submit client requests. You can access documents related to each task on the left panel. Similar to the Documents page, the left panel allows you to access all your documents and groups them by engagement stage. Within these high-level groupings, documents are also organized into folders.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Project Files/SmartEngagement/Images/financial-statements-side-pane-1200x850.png" alt="The left panel" />
        </p>
        <h2 id="Locate-documents">Locate documents</h2>
        <p>In the left panel, your documents are listed by engagement stage. When you open a document, your documents remain displayed in the panel for easy access.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you can use the following features in the left panel to help you locate specific information or documents for your engagement work:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Search</b> - Locate specific information in documents by typing keywords into the <b>Search</b> field. When you perform a search, the left panel displays all matching documents.</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Recent</b> - Access documents that you’ve opened recently. If you use one of the recent documents often while completing an engagement, you can select the <b>pin</b> icon (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Icons/SE icons/pin-icon-11x14.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) beside it to pin the document to the top of the panel for convenient access.</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Document Map</b> - Once you’ve opened a document, you may see a list of its sections on the <b>Document Map</b>, depending on the formatting applied to the document. You can select a section to jump directly to it. This saves you from having to scroll through a lengthy document, such as the financial statement, to view the relevant section.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can open and close the left panel by selecting  the <b>arrow</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Icons/SE icons/chevron-right12x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) at the bottom. Within the left panel, you can also expand and collapse the listed documents as well as the panel's other features by selecting the <b>arrows</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Icons/SE icons/chevron-up14X9.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" />) beside them.</p>
        <h2 id="Display-guidance-for-a-procedure">Display guidance for a procedure</h2>
        <p>In an engagement file, you will typically record your engagement work in documents called <b>checklists</b>. Each checklist includes a series of tasks to guide you through the engagement work, and as you perform each task, you can enter responses or data and sign off on the task.</p>
        <p>Each item in a checklist is called a procedure. Procedures are tasks you’ll need to complete or information you’ll need to gather. They often include fields for you to enter information or conclusions. You can display <b>guidance</b> for these procedures on the left panel.</p>
        <p><b>To display guidance for a procedure:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Select the light bulb icon (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Icons/SE icons/guidance-white-12x16.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) located beside certain procedures to display guidance for them on the left panel. This guidance may present information that helps you to complete the procedure or it may describe the procedure’s outcome.</p>
        <h2 id="Review-prepared-documents">Review prepared documents with review tools</h2>
        <p>On the left pane you can access review tools that make it easier to review an engagement. Review tools are available in checklists, letters and financial statements.</p>
        <p>Review tools apply visual markup to the document, making potential issues stand out on the page so you can complete your review more quickly.</p>
        <p><b>To review a prepared document:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>At the top right of the document, select the <b>Review</b> icon (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/Resources//Icons/SE icons/review-tool-14x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).
