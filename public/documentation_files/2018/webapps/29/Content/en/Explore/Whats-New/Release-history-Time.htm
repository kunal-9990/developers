        <p>The following describes the features and improvements made for CaseWareCloud Time 27.0 (select <b>Help | About</b> to find Cloud's version number).</p>
        <h3>Automatically itemize invoices </h3>

        </p>
        <h3>Create fixed fee invoices</h3>
        <p>The <b>Fixed Fee</b> invoice type is now available. Staff can use a <b>Fixed Fee</b> invoice to bill clients without needing to create time or expense entries. To learn more, see <a href="../../Practice/Time-and-Billing/Draft-an-invoice.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Draft an invoice</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Hide invoices on the Billing page</h3>
        <p>Staff can now hide invoices that are no longer required by setting the status to <b>Closed</b>. This helps ensure that only active invoices are displayed. To learn more, see <a href="../../Practice/Time-and-Billing/Send-an-invoice-to-a-client.htm#Close" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Close an invoice</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="export">Ability to export invoices to QuickBooks Online</h2>

        </p>
        <h2 id="ability">Ability to disable GL features</h2>
        <p>Administrators can now disable general ledger (GL) features. This ensures that only necessary information is collected during the billing process.
