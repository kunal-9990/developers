        <p>As the reviewer, you will be reviewing the fieldwork done by the preparer in an engagement file. You can identify the documents that need to be reviewed and work with the preparer on CaseWare Cloud.</p>
        <h2 id="Check-the-engagement-for-prepared-documents">Check the engagement for prepared documents</h2>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Engagements</b> to open the Engagements page. When you open the page, your default view on the Engagements menu is <b>My Work</b>, and any engagements that you have been assigned a role on are displayed.</p>
        <p>Select an engagement to expand the details. Under <b>Document Status</b>, you can see a breakdown of the status of all the documents in the engagement file. If you see that there are <b>Prepared</b> documents in the file, this means that the preparer has signed off on documents, and they are now ready for review.</p>
        <p>

        <h2 id="Review-prepared-documents">Review prepared documents</h2>
        <p>If your engagement does have prepared documents, you can open the engagement to begin your review.</p>

        </p>
        <p>On the Documents page, each document is displayed with a sign-off icon. Documents that are ready for review will have the <b>Prepared sign off icon</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Icons/SE icons/sign-off-icons-prepared-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) in front of their name.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Open a prepared document to begin your review.</p>
        <h2 id="Create-a-review-note">Create a review note</h2>
        <p>In the document, you will be able to see all of the selections the preparer made and the information that they entered. If you notice a problem with the document, you can add a review note for the preparer.</p>
        <p>A review note is a type of issue that you can create in your engagement file. You can create review notes for specific areas of the document.</p>
        <p><b>To add a review note to a specific area of a document:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>At the end of the line for the document area, select the <b>Add Issue</b> icon (<img src="../Images/issues-in-document-inline.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;width: 30px;height: 29px;" />).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>In the text box, enter a description for your review note.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select the <b>Review</b> issue type from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the editor.</p>
                <p>

            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Select <b>Create Issue</b>.</p>
                <p>The <b>Issues</b> icon (<img src="../Images/issues-showing-total-number.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;width: 40px;height: 36px;" />) displays to indicate that one review note has been added for this line. </p>
                <p>To add another review note on this line, select the <b>Issues</b> icon (<img src="../Images/issues-showing-total-number.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;width: 40px;height: 36px;" />), then select (<img src="../Images/add-issues-on-existing.PNG" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;width: 20px;height: 18px;" />).</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each time a note is added for a line, the displayed total number of notes is updated on the <b>Issues</b> icon. For example, if three notes are added on the line, the <b>Issues</b> icon displays <b>3</b> in the red circle. </p>
        <p>When the preparer opens the document, they can select the <b>Issues</b> icon to view the existing notes. They can also reply to a note if they have any comments or questions.</p>
        <h2 id="Clear-a-resolved-review-note">Clear a resolved review note</h2>
        <p>Once a preparer has reviewed a note and has corrected the problem you identified, they will change the issue status to <b>Resolved</b>. When an issue has been resolved, the <b>Issues</b> icon will still be displayed in the proper area of the document, but there will no longer be a number inside the icon.</p>
        <p>You can select the <b>Issues</b> icon to see any additional details about the resolution. If you are satisfied with the changes that the preparer has made, you can clear the resolved issue. </p>
        <p><b>To clear a review note:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">

                <p>A pop-up displays next to the icon showing the interaction log for the resolved note.</p>
                <p class="note inline"><b>Note</b>: If there is more than one resolved note, left an right arrows (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Icons/SE icons/issues-arrow_15x20.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;width: 15;height: 20;" />) are available on the pop-up. Select the arrows to scroll through the resolved notes.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select <b>Clear</b>.</p>

        </p>
        <h2 id="Sign-off-on-a-document">Sign off on a document</h2>
        <p>Once you have reviewed a document and you have determined that the content is correct, you can sign off on the document to indicate that it is complete.</p>
        <p><b>To sign off on a document:</b>
        </p>

            <li value="1">
                <p>At the top of the document, select the Sign Off drop-down menu. The sign-off roles are displayed. </p>

                <p>Select <b>Sign off</b> beside the role you want to sign off on.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you sign off on the review, the document status is updated. Your name and the date are recorded in the document, and when you go to the Documents page, you will see that the icon now indicates that the document has been reviewed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Project Files/SmartEngagement/Images/documents-optimizer-document-page-reviewed-result-1134x370.png" alt="The Optimizer document now has an icon indicating that it has been reviewed." />
        </p>
        <p>Your engagement is one step closer to being complete. You can see a measure of this completion progress at the top of the section on the Documents page. A small icon displays what percentage of the documents in the section have been reviewed.</p>
