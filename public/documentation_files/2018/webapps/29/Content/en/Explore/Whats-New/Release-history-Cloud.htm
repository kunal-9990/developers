        </p>
        <h3>Improved email notifications for file requests</h3>
        <p>Email notifications for file requests have been improved. File request emails sent to contacts now include the due date, making it clear when files are needed. Also, Contacts will only be emailed when a file request is created and when they are mentioned in a comment, reducing the number of emails sent. To learn more about file requests, see <a href="../../Engagements/Planning/Request-information-from-a-client.htm#Create" class="MCXref xref">Request information from a client</a>.</p>
        <h3>Middle name field now available</h3>
        <p>A middle name field is now available for staff, contacts and individual entities. More flexibility in naming can allow names to be displayed in the way that users prefer.
To learn more about adding staff and contacts, see <a href="../../Setup/Users-and-Groups/Create-an-account-for-staff-or-contacts.htm" class="MCXref xref">Create an account for staff or contacts</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Downtime notifications directly in Cloud</h3>
        <p>Going forward, staff and contacts will be notified in advance about scheduled downtime. Notifications will appear on both he sign-in page and in the Cloud interface. Maintenance notifications will continue to be improved in future releases.

        <h3>Improved engagement management</h3>
        <p>Working Papers 2018 users can now view key engagement metrics directly on the Engagement page. Using Cloud, staff can monitor metrics - including document status, issues, deliverable dates, adjusting entries and more - across multiple engagements simultaneously.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Staff can now create time entries from the Engagement page, making recording billable hours faster. After creating entries, staff can monitor their progress by comparing actual time spent to the amount budgeted.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Backup codes for two-factor authentication</h3>

        <h2 id="cloud26">Cloud 26.0</h2>
        <p><iframe id="vidcenter" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7qSpasB7UY" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </p>
        <p>The following features and improvements were made for CaseWare Cloud 26.0.</p>
        <h3>Two-factor authentication</h3>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> SMS-based two-factor authentication is currently available free of charge on a trial basis. In a future release, our development team will add a second method of two-factor authentication. That method will work with mobile devices, will not rely on SMS, and will be free to use.  When the second method becomes available, there may be additional costs for continued use of SMS-based two-factor authentication.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> For staff members that integrated Working Papers with Cloud, two-factor authentication is only supported with Working Papers 2017.00.296 or later. An administrator must disable two-factor authentication for any staff members using an earlier version of Working Papers; otherwise, they will be unable to sign in.</p>
        <p>Administrators can now require staff and contacts to use two-factor authentication when logging in. Enabling two-factor authentication keeps data safe by reducing the risk of data breaches. Staff and contacts can also choose to enable this feature at their own discretion. To learn more, see <a href="../../Setup/Security/Login-settings.htm#Configur" class="MCXref xref">Configure two-factor authentication </a>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Images/firm-settings-authentication-session-management-two-factor.png" alt="The two-factor authentication section of the Authentication and Session Management page." />
        </p>
        <h3>Streamlined file interface</h3>
        <p>Engagement files (such as <b>Working Papers</b> and <b>Other Engagements</b>) are now listed separately from other files (such as PDF and CSV). Engagement files no longer display on the <b>Files</b> page. They now display on their individual product page.</p>
        <h3>Custom filters to views</h3>
        <p>In <b>Views Management</b>, administrators can now add default filters such as date, tags and workflow to views they create. Adding custom filters to views lets staff and contacts easily find the files they need. To learn more about creating views, see <a href="../../Setup/Organization/Create-views-for-all-users.htm" class="MCXref xref">Create views for all users</a>. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Improved filtering capabilities</h3>
        <p>Staff and contacts can now filter by multiple selections in a filter category. Filter selections are saved across sessions, ensuring files are easier to find.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Images/files-filter-or-filter.png" alt="The filter drop-down menu on the Files page." />
        </p>
        <h3>Improved imports for entity fields</h3>
        <p>Administrators can now map <b>Country of Registration</b> and <b>Organization Type</b> fields when importing a group of entities from a CSV file, increasing the type of entity information that can be imported. New import fields, such as the <b>Taxpayer Identification Number</b>, have been added for individual entity types. To learn more about importing a group of entities, see <a href="../../Setup/Organization/Create-client-workspaces.htm#Creating" class="MCXref xref">Creating client workspaces from a client list</a>.</p>
        <h3>General improvements</h3>

            <li value="1">

        <h3>Automatic Contact creation for Individual entities</h3>
        <p>It is now easier to create and manage <b>Individual</b> client entities. Contacts are now automatically added and assigned to the Individual entity during the creation process. You also have the option to create an Individual client entity from an existing contact.</p>

            <li value="1">
                <p>When creating or editing an entity, the <b>Business Number</b> field now changes dynamically based on your selections in the <b>Organization Type</b> field and the <b>Country of Residence</b>field.  This makes it easier to enter relevant information about an entity.</p>

        <p>The following features and improvements were made for CaseWare Cloud 24.0.</p>
        <h3>User interface</h3>
        <p>We've made significant improvements to the Cloud interface.</p>
        <h4>Welcome page</h4>
        <p>You will now see a Welcome page when you first log in. The Welcome page contains information to get you up and running faster, with customized content for administrators, staff members and contacts. You can access the Welcome page at any time.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Images/welcome-modal-en-702x585.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>Cloud status</h4>
        <p>A <b>CaseWare Cloud status</b> page is now available for you to see the availability and status of servers in your region. You can find frequent status updates on issues or maintenance to servers in your region. You can access this page from the Help menu or from the Cloud login page.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Images/cloud-status-en-905x676.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>Dashboards</h4>
        <p>We've added a <b>Timeline gadget</b> for use in Cloud dashboards. You can now pull your timeline activities into new dashboards that you create, enabling you to see more information at a glance and better manage your organization's activity in Cloud. For a list of available gadgets, see <a href="../Interface/Dashboards/Gadget-list.htm" class="MCXref xref">Gadget list (Dashboards)</a>. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Images/dashboard-timeline-widget-en-630x461.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Cloud billing</h3>
        <p>Per-user license purchasing is now available - buy exactly as many licenses as you need for your organization for apps like <b>Time and Billing</b>.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you can now see the number of licenses available to your organization for different Cloud products. As an administrator, you can review your license usage at a glance from the <b>Cloud Billing</b> section of Firm Settings. To learn more, see <a href="../../Setup/Administration-and-Settings/Managing-your-CaseWare-Cloud-licenses.htm" class="MCXref xref">Manage your CaseWare Cloud licenses</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Activities</h3>
        <p>We've added a <b>Subscription Notification</b> filter to the Activities app. You can select this filter to view only the entity activities and content that you have subscribed to, helping you monitor the activities relevant to your tasks. For more information, see <a href="Frequently-asked-questions.htm#Activiti" class="MCXref xref">Activities</a>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Project Files/Activities/Images/activities-subscription-filter-en-1693x304.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Files</h3>
        <p>When you want to share a file with another person, you can now only select the <b>Share</b> button if you have selected a security role for the user's profile. This ensures that you will know that the file has been shared and that the staff member or contact can work on the shared content. To learn more about managing files on Cloud, see <a href="Frequently-asked-questions.htm#Files" class="MCXref xref">Files</a>.</p>
        <h4>Other Engagement</h4>
        <p>When you create or edit an <b>Other Engagement</b>, you can now attach existing files from Cloud to it. For example, if your client uploads a TaxPrep file to Cloud, you can now attach that file right when you create an Other Engagement. Additionally, your client contacts can now create Other Engagement files in Cloud. This enables them to take a more direct role in the engagement setup process. For more information, see <a href="../Features/Other-Engagements.htm" class="MCXref xref">Other Engagements</a>. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Images/other-engagements-new-select-existing-file-684x948.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You can now set a retention period for <b>Other Engagement</b> files. At the end of the retention period, your online engagement is automatically removed from Cloud. This makes Cloud maintenance much easier, as you will no longer need to manually remove old engagements.</p>
        <h3>Engagements</h3>
        <p>In the Engagements (Beta) page, you can now see if an engagement has any late requests by viewing the <b>Document Status</b> section. This makes it easier for you to manage your engagements, by knowing when to follow up with client contacts. For more information, see <a href="../Features/Engagements-page.htm" class="MCXref xref">Engagements page</a>. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Images/engagments-late-requests-en-1400x581.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Entities</h3>
        <p>When you are importing a list of entities in the <b>Entities</b> app, you can now import information into more fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Operating name</p>

        <h3>People</h3>
        <p>You can now see your staff's position while you are looking at the <b>Summary View</b> on the Staff app. </p>
        <p>You can also filter staff members based on their position, ans we've also added an option to filter either staff or contacts by which apps they have access to.</p>
        <p>
