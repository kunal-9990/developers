        <h1>Create a private file or activity</h1>
        <p>When you add content to Cloud, you associate an entity with that content. By default, any users who have a security role assigned on your chosen entity will be able to see your content.</p>
        <p>You can set files or activities in Cloud to override this general access rule by using the  <b>Limited</b> sharing setting. When you limit a file or activity it is only visible to Cloud administrators, to the owner of the file, and to specific users granted access by the file owner. When you use the <b>Limited</b> sharing setting to create private files and activities, you can directly control access to them.</p>
        <h2 id="create-private-file">Creating a private file</h2>
        <p>You might want to create a document under a client entity that is only visible to specific members of the current engagement team. For example, as a manager, you might create a document to record your feedback about the other staff members on your engagement team. This document would be invisible to your engagement team, but you could share it with a partner or with other managers. </p>
