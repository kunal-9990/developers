        <h2>Common adjustment types</h2>
        <p>Adjustment types include  normal entries, reclassifying entries, uncorrected entries, and tax entries. Here are some  examples of the most common adjustment types and a brief description.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><b>Normal</b>: Use to update all relevant automatic documents such as journals, ledgers, trial balance, financial statements, and leadsheets. When updating from one period to another, including a year-end close, these entries are transferred from the adjustment column to the opening or preliminary balance column on the trial balance and leadsheet documents.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><b>Reclassifying</b>: These are not recorded in the normal accounting records. However, they are recorded in all financial statements and working papers such as leadsheets. When made in any period other than the last period of the fiscal year, reclassifying entries are excluded from the accounting records. In this case, the entries to non-consolidated balances do not have to be reversed.</p>
                <p>Reclassifying entries made in the last period of the fiscal year get included in the next year's opening balances when either of the following choices is made during a year end close: Update next year's opening balance with consolidated or report. Those reclassifying entries then have to be reversed.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p><b>Eliminating</b>: Use to prepare combinations or consolidations of divisions or companies. These entries appear in consolidated trial balances, leadsheets, and financial statement documents.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p><b>Unrecorded - Factual</b>: These represent factual misstatements that will not be recorded because of materiality or proposed entries that may be subsequently changed to a normal status. These entries appear on the Summary of Uncorrected Misstatements Document.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p><b>Unrecorded - Projected</b>: These represent projected misstatements that are unrecorded based on the auditorâ€™s best estimates of misstatements in populations, usually derived from sampling. These entries appear on the Summary of Uncorrected Misstatements Document.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p><b>Unrecorded - Judgmental</b>: These represent judgmental misstatements that are unrecorded based on differences arising from the judgments of management concerning accounting estimates, or the selection or application of accounting policies that the auditor considers inappropriate or unreasonable. These entries appear on the Summary of Uncorrected Misstatements Document.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="7">
                <p><b>Tax - Federal</b>: These adjust the federal tax balance. They are not recorded in the normal accounting records. Use the trial balance, journal, and leadsheet documents to display the federal tax entries. If creating a Journal - Adjusting journal entries automatic document, any Permanent or Temporary adjusting entry displays in the Difference column of the report.</p>
            </li>

                <p><b>Tax - State</b>: These adjust the state tax balance. They are not recorded in the normal accounting records. Use the trial balance, journal, and leadsheet documents to display the state tax entries.</p>
            </li>
