        <h1>Prepare financial statements </h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/nl/Resources//Snippets/TopicRequiresSEproduct.flsnp" />
        <p>As you set up your engagement, the financial statement will begin populating data automatically. You can continue preparing the financial statement by selecting <b>Documents</b> and then the <b>Financial statements</b> document.</p>
        <h2 id="View-the-accounts-associated-with-a-balance">View the accounts associated with a balance</h2>
        <p>While reviewing the balance sheets or dynamic tables on the financial statements, you can view more detailed information about balances and accounts associated with them.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/nl/Resources//Snippets/To-view-accounts-associated-with-a-balance.flsnp" />
        <p>The balance is displayed with its associated accounts.</p>
        <h2 id="Populate-the-Cash-Flow-Statement">Populate the Cash Flow Statement</h2>
        <p>The Financial Statement document populates financial data automatically from your trial balance. When you have data that does not derive from the trial balance, you can manually enter it in the cash flow statement so that it transfers through to your balance sheet.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/nl/Resources//Snippets/To-enter-data-into-the-cash-flow-statement.flsnp" />
        <p>The new data is entered into the cash flow statement and calculated in the balance sheet.</p>
        <h2 id="Expand-a-statement-row-to-display-more-detail">Expand a statement row to display more detail</h2>
        <p>In some financial statements documents, you can choose to display the financial details for each individual account or to only display the sums for certain account categories.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose that you had the following accounts in the balance sheet:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/nl/Resources//Project Files/SmartEngagement/Images/financial-statements-expand-line-expanded-1134x420.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>You can collapse the individual lines under <b>Property, Plant and Equipment</b> and only display the sum for that category.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/nl/Resources//Snippets/To-expand-a-row.flsnp" />
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Expandable rows in the financial statements may not be available in all SmartEngagement products.</p>
        <h2 id="Cross-reference-a-row-in-the-financial-statements-with-a-note">Cross-reference a row in the financial statements with a note</h2>
        <p>Smart Engagement includes a pre-populated note library that you can cross-reference on your financial statement. Each row of the financial statement can be attributed its own set of relevant notes.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/nl/Resources//Snippets/To-cross-reference-a-row-in-the-financial-statement.flsnp" />
        <p>The selected notes are referenced on the financial statement row. The note numbers display next to the row name for quick viewing.</p>
        <p>

        <p>For information about making other formatting or content changes to the financial statements document, see <a href="../../Practice/Templates-and-Authoring/Customize-financial-statements.htm">Customize financial statements</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="Print-the-Financial-Statements">Print the Financial Statements</h2>
        <p>If you require a physical or digital copy of the current financial statement, you can print the statement. The <b>Print</b> option converts the current statement into PDF format, which you can print or mail as required. To adjust how the financial statement will look once converted, you can first modify the <b>Print Settings</b>.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/nl/Resources//Snippets/To-modify-the-print-settings.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/nl/Resources//Snippets/To-print-the-financial-statements.flsnp" />
        <p>The financial statement is converted to PDF for printing or saving.</p>
