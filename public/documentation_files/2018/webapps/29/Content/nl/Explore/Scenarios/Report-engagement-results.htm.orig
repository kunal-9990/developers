        <p>Once you have finished with all of the fieldwork for your online engagement, your next step is to create a report based on your results.</p>
        <h2 id="Customize-the-financial-statements">Customize the financial statements</h2>
        <p>At the conclusion of the engagement, you will create a financial statements document for the client where you explain your findings and present a conclusion. Many online engagement products have a built-in template that will make it easier for you to prepare your financial statements.</p>
        <p>The financial statements document is automatically populated with some data as you complete other documents. However, you will need to make other changes to customize the financial statements for your client.</p>
        <h2>Add the information specified in placeholder fields</h2>
        <p>The financial statement typically includes an introductory letter created from a template. The template’s contents can include placeholder fields that you need to replace with specific information related to your engagement, organization or client.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/nl/Resources//Snippets/to-replace-placeholder-fields.flsnp" />
        <h2 id="Expand-or-collapse-rows">Expand or collapse rows in statements and tables</h2>
        <p>In some financial statements documents, you can choose to display the financial details for each individual account or to display only the sums for certain account categories.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose that you had created the following dynamic table:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/nl/Resources//Project Files/SmartEngagement/Images/financial-statements-expand-line-expanded-1134x420.png" alt="A dynamic table with a breakdown of property, plant and equipment." />
        </p>
        <p>You can collapse the individual lines under <b>Property, Plant and Equipment</b> and display only the sum for that category.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/nl/Resources//Snippets/To-expand-a-row.flsnp" />
        <h2 id="Cross-reference-a-row-in-the-financial-statements-with-a-note">Cross-reference a row in the financial statements with a note</h2>
        <p>Many online engagement products include a pre-populated note library that you can cross-reference on your financial statement. Each row of the financial statement can be attributed its own set of relevant notes.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/nl/Resources//Snippets/To-cross-reference-a-row-in-the-financial-statement.flsnp" />
        <h2 id="Edit-a-note">Edit a note</h2>
        <p>The last large section of the financial statements document is the <b>Notes to the Financial Statements</b>. In this section, you can provide notes for your client that include any supplementary information about the results of your engagement.</p>
        <p>Select the <b>Edit button</b> at the top of the page in order to edit your notes. When the financial statements document is in edit mode, you can make changes to each of the sections within the notes.</p>
