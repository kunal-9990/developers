        <h2 id="improved">Improved email notifications for file requests</h2>
        <p>Email notifications for file requests have been improved. File request emails sent to contacts now include the due date, making it clear when files are needed. Also, Contacts will only be emailed when a file request is created and when they are mentioned in a comment, reducing the number of emails sent. To learn more about file requests, see <a href="../../Engagements/Planning/Request-information-from-a-client.htm#Create" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Create a file request from a client workspace</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="middle">Middle name field now available</h2>
        <p>A middle name field is now available for staff, contacts and individual entities. More flexibility in naming can allow names to be displayed in the way that users prefer. To learn more about adding staff and contacts, see <a href="../../Setup/Users-and-Groups/Create-an-account-for-staff-or-contacts.htm" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{paratext}">Maak een account aan voor medewerkers of contactpersonen</a>.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2 id="main">Downtime notifications directly in Cloud</h2>
        <p>Going forward, staff and contacts will be notified in advance about scheduled downtime. Notifications will appear on both he sign-in page and in the Cloud interface. Maintenance notifications will continue to be improved in future releases. </p>

        <p>Review on the Go (RotG) is a solution that spans CaseWareâ€™s Desktop and Cloud platforms.
