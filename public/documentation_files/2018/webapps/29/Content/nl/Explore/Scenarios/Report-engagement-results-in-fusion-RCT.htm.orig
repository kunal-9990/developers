        <p>Once you finish the fieldwork for your online engagement, your next step is to conclude the engagement. </p>
        <h2>Prepare the financial statements</h2>
        <p>You can create a financial statements document for the client where you explain your findings and present a conclusion. The financial statements document is automatically populated with some data as you complete other documents. However, you need to  customize the financial statements document for your client.</p>
        <p>To prepare the financial statements in Fusion RCT, see <a href="../../Engagements/Statements-and-Conclusions/Prepare-financial-statements-in-fusion-RCT.htm">Prepare financial statements</a> and <a href="../../Practice/Templates-and-Authoring/Customize-financial-statements-in-Fusion-RCT.htm">Customize financial statements</a>.</p>
        <h2>Review changes in the financial statements</h2>
        <p>You can review the changes  made by your engagement team members to the financial statements. This includes added, modified and deleted content. Review tools mark the changes made by your team    from the original template  created by the author. The following tools are available:</p>

        </p>
        <p>You can also filter the displayed changes. For example, if you are reviewing dynamic tables, you can filter out all other types of changes and show dynamic table changes only.</p>
