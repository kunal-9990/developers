        <h1>CaseWare Q FAQ</h1>
        <p>This topic discusses some of the frequently asked questions (FAQs) and known issues when using <b>CaseWare Q</b>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><b>How should my organization use Q?</b>
                </p>
                <p>An administrator at your organization should set up the <a href="../../../../../../../../../Docs/webapps/Content/Engagement_Management_onCloud/Audit_Q/t_Q_Audit_Firm_Setup.htm">Q firm settings</a> in the organization's <a href="../../../../Practice/Management/Set-up-dashboards-to-monitor-the-audit-(Q).htm#create-Q-template">Q integrated template</a>. When creating a new engagement file from the template, or during the planning stage of the Audit, a senior person should populate the <a href="../../../../../../../../../Docs/webapps/Content/Engagement_Management_onCloud/Audit_Q/t_Q_Audit_Engagement_Setup.htm">engagement information</a> on the Q file. By completing both parts of Q, and <a href="../../../../../../../../../Docs/webapps/Content/WorkingPapers/t_Working_Papers_SmartSync_Publish_to_Server.htm">publishing the client file to Cloud</a>, <a href="../../../../../../../../../Docs/webapps/Content/Engagement_Management_onCloud/Audit_Q/r_Q_Audit_Interface.htm">the Q detail</a> will auto-populate as the audit progresses.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><b>Will a user have to open up Q at the end of each audit phase and update it?</b>
                </p>
                <p>No. Once the initial setup mentioned above is complete, no further input is required.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p><b>Where can I get more information on when to open Q and when to complete each area?</b>
                </p>
                <p>Once the initial setup is complete, all areas in Q will populate automatically. If content is not updating, please contact your administrator for assistance. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p><b>Can I set up multiple Q documents for different types of engagements and statuses?</b>
                </p>
                <p>Yes, you can add multiple Q documents to the master template. When creating a new engagement file from the template, select which one applies and remove the rest.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p><b>What is the purpose of the second row of annotations in Settings | Status?</b>
                </p>
                <p>The second row of annotations corresponds to the sign-off event for the role selected in the second drop-down.</p>
                <p>Use when requiring a second sign-off event for a document already annotated in the first row, or for a different document related to the same status that requires a unique role sign-off.</p>
            </li>
