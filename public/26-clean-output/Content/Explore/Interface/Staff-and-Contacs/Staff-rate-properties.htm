        <p>Rates can be assigned to staff members based on the <b>work codes</b> set up for the company.  This enables the company to assign individual rates to staff members while maintaining a standard set of work codes across the company.</p>
        <p>You can also set work codes to a zero (0) rate to record time but at no charge.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note:</b>&#160;Staff members without a standard rate can still post entries to time. Their rate will amount to zero&#160;(0).</p>
        <p>Staff rates have the following properties:</p>
