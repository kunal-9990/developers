        <p>Your timeline is record of your organization's activities on Cloud. The types of activities that appear on your organization's timeline include discussions, tasks, queries and file requests. Using the <b>Timeline</b> page, you can display a list of activities in several formats. Review this list to get an overview of work completed in Cloud.</p>
        <p>Each activity listed includes a summary. That summary indicates which user performed the activity, what they did and when they did it. To review an activity in further detail, select the Expand icon(<img src="../../Resources/Icons/Expand.png" alt="The expand icon" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>
        <p>You can also use the Timeline page to review system activities. System activities include events such as a staff member creating or accessing a file. To prevent clutter, the Timeline page displays system activities separately. To see them, select the Activities menu, then choose System Activities.</p>
