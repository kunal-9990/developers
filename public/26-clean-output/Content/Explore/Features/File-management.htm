        <h1>File management</h1><iframe id="vid" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwWbmDtoOGM" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p>Using CaseWare Cloud, your organization can manage files conveniently and securely. Files on Cloud can be accessed from any location, enabling you to work offsite securely and making team collaboration easy.</p>
        <p>In addition to uploading files from your desktop, you can also create links to shared documents in Google Drive, OneDrive or SharePoint accounts. If your organization uses Working Papers, you can create parent copies of Working Papers files and host them on Cloud, and other staff members can then work in synchronized child copies. For more on Working Papers integration, see <a href="../../Setup/Environments-and-Configuration/Integrate-your-Working-Papers-with-Cloud.htm" class="MCXref_0" xrefformat="{paratext}">Integrate your Working Papers with Cloud</a>. When you use Cloud to store all of the important files for your organization’s day-to-day work in one place, your staff members can save time by not having to switch between different tools or network folders to find the information they need most. To learn more, see <a href="../../Engagements/Documentation-and-Review/Share-reports-and-documents.htm" class="MCXref_0" xrefformat="{paratext}">Share reports and documents</a> and <a href="../../Setup/Environments-and-Configuration/Integrate-your-Working-Papers-with-Cloud.htm" class="MCXref_0" xrefformat="{paratext}">Integrate your Working Papers with Cloud</a>. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Cloud also makes it easy for you to organize your files. For each new file that you add to Cloud, you can assign it to an appropriate client or internal workspace that you created during setup. You can further organize files into folders within these workspaces. To learn more, see <a href="../../Setup/Administration-and-Settings/Organize-files-by-folders-and-tags.htm" class="MCXref_0" xrefformat="{paratext}">Organize files by folders and tags</a>.</p>
        <p>You also have control over the security settings for your files. When you store a file in a specific workspace, you automatically restrict access to it so that only staff members and contacts who have permission to see that workspace can see the file. For confidential files, you can set a file as Limited, to further restrict access; only you will be able to view it until you explicitly share the file with others. To learn more, see <a href="../../Setup/Security/Create-a-private-file-or-activity.htm" class="MCXref_0" xrefformat="{paratext}">Create a private file or activity</a></p>

        </p>
        <p>Storing your files in Cloud also enables you to create discussions or tasks related to them, and review them directly from Cloud. You can also see a record of all of the user activity for a file, which enables you to better track when work was done on it. Files even have retention settings: you can set a date for the file to be automatically removed from Cloud. This makes compliance easier, as you can guarantee that files are not kept longer than a mandated duration, and it also makes it easier for you to keep your organization’s Cloud storage from being cluttered with old data.
