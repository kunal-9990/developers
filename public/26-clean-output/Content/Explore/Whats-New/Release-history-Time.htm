        </p>
        <p>The following features and improvements were made for CaseWareCloud Time 26.0.</p>
        <h2 id="export">Ability to export invoices to QuickBooks Online</h2>
        <p>Administrators can now link Cloud with an existing QuickBooks Online (QBO) account. Invoices can then be exported directly to QBO to track payments and manage receivables.
To learn more about exporting invoices, see <a href="../../Practice/Time-and-Billing/Integrate-Cloud-with-QuickBooks-Online.htm" class="MCXref_0" xrefformat="{paratext}">Integrate Cloud with QuickBooks Online</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <h2 id="ability">Ability to disable GL features</h2>
        <p>Administrators can now disable general ledger (GL) features. This ensures that only necessary information is collected during the billing process. If an organization has never used GL features, GL will be disabled during migration to 26.0. New organizations will have GL features disabled by default.
Administrators can enable or disable GL features by selecting <b>Firm Settings | Time | General | Time and Expense Settings | Enable general ledger</b>.</p>
        <h2 id="billing">Billing page improvements</h2>
        <p>A number of improvements have been made to the <b>Billing</b> page, including:</p>

        <h3 id="billing-report">The Billing report</h3>
        <p>Determine your staff's productivity with the new Billing analysis report.

By comparing a staff memberâ€™s effective rate with their billing rate, you can determine where the most value is being added.</p>

        </p>
        <h3 id="bulk-import">Import time and expense entries in bulk</h3>
        <p>You can now import time and expense entries from a CSV file, making it easier to transfer entries from other systems to Cloud.</p>

        <h3 id="time-license">Time license management</h3>
        <p>You can now grant access to the Time app and its tools on the <b>Apps</b> tab in the Create and Edit staff dialogs. This makes it easier to manage Time app access, bringing it in line with other Cloud apps that require licenses. The permissions for Time and Expense that were under <b>Security | Role Permissions</b> on the Firm Settings page have been removed. To learn more, see <a href="../../Setup/Users-and-Groups/Setting-staff-access-levels.htm#Setting" class="MCXref_0" xrefformat="{paratext}">Setting access to Cloud apps</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="transfer-time-and-expense">Transfer time and expense entries</h3>
        <p>You can now transfer time and expense entries between entities. This enables you to consolidate time and expense entries when you need to delete an entity, or move entries that were added to the wrong entity by accident. Entries can be moved to another entity, or a specific engagement associated with that entity. To learn more, see <a href="../../Practice/Management/Tracking-staff-work-during-the-engagement.htm#Transfer" class="MCXref_0" xrefformat="{paratext}">Transfer time or expense entries</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <h3 id="improved-invoice">Improved invoice customization </h3>
        <p>You can now add multiple line items to invoices. Invoice line items can be created using pre-existing work codes and billing codes, or by entering a custom line item.
