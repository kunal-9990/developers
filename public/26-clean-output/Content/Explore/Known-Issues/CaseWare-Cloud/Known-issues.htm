        <h2>Error when importing entities from a CSV&#160;file</h2>

        <h2 id="Internet">Internet Explorer entity selection issue</h2>
        <p>Users accessing Cloud using Internet Explorer may experience an issue in the Engagements page when attempting to create a new engagement. When users select New and the engagement type, they are asked to select an entity from a drop-down list, but it takes several clicks before the entity is selected and the drop-down list clears.  To work around this issue, use an alternative browser (such as Chrome or Firefox) when using the Engagements app.</p>

        <h2>Error messages on the Working Papers page</h2>
        <p>Inaccurate error messages are sometimes displayed when abandoning a sync copy or when clearing sync information on the Working Papers page. To work around this issue, wait a few minutes and then refresh the page to confirm the intended action took place.</p>
