        <h1>Known issues in Analytics</h1>
        <p>The following known issues affect the current version of CaseWareCloud Analytics. They will be resolved in a future release.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Currently, content pages are limited to display only 5,000 records from the original file. This is just a display issue - the tests are checking the entire data file. Files with over 5,000 records will be better-displayed in a future release.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Xero imports do not support subledger data (such as Inventory and Accounts Receivable). We will be adding support for this data, as well as the tests that require these data types, in a future release.</p>
