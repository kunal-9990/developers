        <h2 id="Viewing-system-activities">Viewing system activities</h2>
        <p>System activities are generated for all kinds of events that occur in Cloud, including file uploads, change in security settings, posting of activities, and other events.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To view system activities:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>In the <b>Cloud</b> menu, open the <b>Activities</b> app.</p>

        <h2 id="Viewing-file-history">Viewing file history</h2>
        <p>You can view any changes made to a file so that you are aware of any unwanted changes or who has been currently working on the file. </p>
        <p>Cloud also keeps previous versions of uploaded files so that you can revert if the newly uploaded version is incorrect. See <a href="Recover-a-previous-version-or-deleted-file.htm#Recoveri">Recovering Previous Versions</a> for more information.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To view file history:</p>
