        <p>When you are finished with an invoice, you can change its status to <b>Closed</b> to indicate it no longer needs attention.  For example, you would change the status of an invoice to <b>Closed</b> after it is paid in full. After an invoice is closed, it is hidden on the <b>Invoices</b> tab. You can display closed invoices using the <b>Closed</b> filter. To learn more, see <MadCap:xref href="#Display">Display closed invoices</MadCap:xref>.</p>
