        <p>You can export invoices from Cloud to QuickBooks Online (QBO) by integrating the two services. This process is faster and more precise than manual transcription.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: To integrate Cloud with QBO, the general ledger must be disabled in Settings. For more information about disabling the general ledger (GL), see <a href="../../Explore/Interface/Firm-Settings/Time.htm#Time" class="MCXref_0">Time and Expense Settings</a></p>

        <p>Once Cloud is linked to QuickBooks Online, you can configure your QBO integration settings.</p>
        <h2 id="set-default">Set the default tax rate for exports</h2>
        <p>When exporting invoices from Cloud to QBO, the tax jurisdiction is mapped using a best-effort approach based on the primary and secondary tax rates set in Cloud. You can set a default tax jurisdiction by selecting a <b>Default Tax Rate</b> in Cloud. So if your clients are generally located in the same jurisdiction as your business, set the Default Tax Rate to your own tax jurisdiction. If you are exporting invoices for clients outside of your own jurisdiction, you may have to manually set the correct tax jurisdiction in QBO after performing the export.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose your business operates out of Nova Scotia, Canada and you have clients in both Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Both these jurisdictions require an HST tax of 15% applied to all goods and services. Now most of your clients are in Nova Scotia, so it would make more sense to set the Default Tax Rate to Nova Scotia. This way every exported invoice that charges a 15% HST tax will have Nova Scotia set as the jurisdiction in QBO. If you export an invoice for New Brunswick (which also has a 15% HST tax), you’ll have to manually change the jurisdiction in QBO.</p>

        <h2 id="export-invoice">Export an invoice to QuickBooks Online</h2>
        <p>After integrating, you can export finalized invoices. Exporting is the fastest method of moving your invoices from Cloud to QBO.</p>
        <h3>Restrictions</h3>
        <p>Before exporting an invoice, note the following restrictions.</p>
        <h4>Invoices cannot be synchronized with QBO</h4>
        <p>If you need to modify an invoice after it has been exported, you’ll have to perform the export again to ensure both Cloud and QBO are up to date. First, delete the exported invoice in QBO, make the necessary adjustments in Cloud, and then perform the export to QBO again. If you’re deleting an invoice from one software, then ensure to delete it from the other as well.</p>
        <h4>Invoices marked Paid in QBO are closed in Cloud</h4>
        <p>Marking an invoice <b>Paid</b> in QBO sets the status of that invoice to <b>Closed</b> in Cloud.</p>
        <h4>Exporting and editing client information is limited</h4>
        <p>When you export an invoice, Time attempts to associate the invoice to a pre-existing client in QBO. If no match is found, a new client is created using the entity name from Cloud. To change client information after an export, update it manually in both Cloud and QBO.</p>
        <p><b>To export an invoice to QuickBooks Online:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">

        <h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions </h2>
        <p><b>What if I find a mistake on a finalized invoice that I've exported to QBO?</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can change the status of the invoice from <b>Finalized</b> to <b>Draft</b> and make edits as you normally would. The invoice is automatically removed from QBO, and any payment information is retained. When you've made your changes, export the invoice again. </p>
        <p><b>What if there is an issue with an invoice after a client has paid?</b>
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Paid invoices are automatically marked as <b>Closed</b> in Cloud. To make changes, change the status of the invoice from <b>Closed</b> to <b>Finalized</b>. After you change the invoice status in Cloud, its status in QBO changes to outstanding automatically. Payment information is retained separately. To learn more about editing closed invoices, see <a href="Send-an-invoice-to-a-client.htm#Display" class="MCXref_0">Display closed invoices</a>.<br /></p>
        <p><b>What happens if an invoice is deleted in QBO, or if its status is changed from paid to outstanding?</b>
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">The invoice's status in Cloud will be changed from <b>Closed</b> to <b>Finalized</b> automatically. </p>
