        <p>Review notes can be added to an engagement workspace (entity) or to documents, checklists and other engagement artifacts in an engagement file (online and desktop). Review notes can signal to the engagement team that additional work is required on a document or that specific tasks must be completed for an engagement. </p>
        <p>In CaseWare Cloud, review notes are referred to as <b>tasks</b> and are added to the engagement workspace (entities). In an engagement file (such as Working Papers), review notes are referred to as <b>issues</b>.</p>
        <p class="bestpractice"><b>Best Practice:</b> It's better to create an <b>issue</b> from within the engagement file so that your team can have context as to which document, checklist, line or engagement requires attention. For general review notes, consider using the tasks feature in the engagement workspace.</p>
        <h2 id="Add-review-notes-to-an-engagement-workspace">Add review notes to a client workspace</h2>
        <p>Adding tasks to an engagement workspace enables you to define all the work that is required for a particular engagement. As the engagement team resolves tasks, you can track the engagement progress and assess when the expected completion date for the engagement will be.</p>
        <p><b>To create a task:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure you have the <i>Entity Access</i> role or equivalent rights to the entity.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Activities</b>.</p>
