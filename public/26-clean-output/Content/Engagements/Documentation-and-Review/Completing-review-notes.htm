        <p>When completing review notes you may be required to collaborate with other staff and client contacts. Whether you're assigned a review note from an engagement file or the engagement workspace, you can easily ping and tag other people on the item to get clarification or additional client information. </p>
        <p>Once complete, mark the <b>task as completed</b> or the <b>issue as resolved</b>. </p>
        <p>In an engagement file you also have the option to <b>clear the issue</b>, thereby removing the notice while maintaining the note itself.</p>
        <p class="bestpractice"><b>Best Practice:</b> It's better to create an <b>issue</b> from within the engagement file so that your team can have context as to which document, checklist, line or engagement requires attention. For general review notes, consider using the tasks feature in the engagement workspace.</p>

        <p>When assigned tasks from the engagement workspace (entity), you can respond and collaborate with other staff and client contacts to complete the work. When you're finished simply change the state of the task to <b>Completed</b>.</p>
