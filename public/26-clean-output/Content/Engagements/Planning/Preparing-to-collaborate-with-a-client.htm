        <p>During your engagement work, your team will spend time working directly with your client. You might collaborate closely with one individual, or you might have multiple contacts at a client company who will assist you with different areas or questions.</p>
        <p>You can add client contacts to your organization’s Cloud profile. Setting up contact users and groups helps organize the engagement work, since members of your engagement team will be able to reach out to clients directly through Cloud, and discussions with the client are included in activity history, making them easy to review.</p>
        <h2 id="create-contact">How to create a contact</h2>
        <p>There are one or more dedicated contacts in your client’s organization who have been assigned to help your team with any tasks or information that you need for the engagement. You can create special user profiles for client contacts in Cloud, enabling the contacts to collaborate with your team.</p>
        <p><b>To create a contact:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Staff Admin</i> role or equivalent rights.</p>
