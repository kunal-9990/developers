        <p>During the course of an engagement, the simplest way to see work assigned to you is by applying filters to the <b>Activities</b> page. In Cloud, work is represented by <b>tasks</b> assigned to you. You may also want to view any current <b>file requests</b> you’ve made to clients.</p>
        <h2 id="Reviewing-your-assigned-tasks">Reviewing your assigned tasks</h2>
        <p><b>To view tasks assigned to me:</b>

                <p>From the Activities drop-down, choose <b>Tasks</b>.</p>
