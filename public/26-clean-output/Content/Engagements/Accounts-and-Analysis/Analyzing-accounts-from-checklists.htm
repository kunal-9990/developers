        <p>Some checklists include an <b>Analysis</b> section. You can display it by selecting <b>Analysis</b> at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>In the Analysis section, you can see information that is relevant to the procedures in the checklist below. Tables display specific groups and accounts from the trial balance, while charts give a visual representation of financial data.</p>

        </p>
        <p>You can use the information in the Analysis section to complete checklists and work programs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>The most relevant financial information is displayed on the same page as its checklist, so you will not need to have the trial balance open in a separate tab or page.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>The information is displayed graphically, which makes it easier to perform high-level analysis and to identify areas of the trial balance that you may need to investigate further.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>You can hide or display specific tables or charts by selecting the toggles at the top of the Analysis section.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>You can use the drop-down menu at the top of the section to switch the display between <b>preliminary</b> balances and <b>final</b> balances.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Each table or chart has a section where you can enter comments or other information as you work.</p>

                <p>On the tables, you can add annotations for accounts or financial groups by selecting the <b>add annotation icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/annotation-add-16x16.png" alt="Add annotation icon" />) at the end of the line.</p>
