        <p>In order for your trial balance to display financial data properly, you must assign your accounts to their associated groupings. This process is known as mapping the trial balance. </p>
        <p>Accounts are typically assigned automatically after an import. However, for accounts that cannot be automatically assigned or belong to a unique group, you'll have to manually assign the account to the grouping.</p>

        <p>When adding newly created or imported accounts to the trial balance, you must assign them to the appropriate grouping for financial data to populate.</p>
        <p><b>To assign an account to a grouping:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>From the top menu, select <b>Trial Balance</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select the grouping menu and choose one of the available grouping structures.</p>
