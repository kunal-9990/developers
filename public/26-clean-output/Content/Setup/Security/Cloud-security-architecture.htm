        <p>CaseWare takes the security of your data very seriously. Below, you can find information about the security structure for Cloud.</p>
        <h2 id="where-data-stored">Where is my data stored?</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored in data centers operated by Amazon Web Services. These servers may be located outside of the country you are working from. CaseWare Cloud utilizes Amazon Web Servers in the United States for the Americas, in Australia for Asia-Pacific clients, and in Ireland for other jurisdictions. All of your data, including your backup data, is in the same region.</p>
        <h2 id="how-data-protected">How is my data protected?</h2>
        <p>Amazon provides physical security and logical security controls at the infrastructure layer. The platform is covered by a SSAE 16 report (by Ernst and Young) and is PCI Level 1 certified, ISO 27001 certified, and compliant with all major security control frameworks.</p>
        <p>CaseWare Cloud uses AES 256-bit encryption keys - the same strength used in online banking. The encryption keys are generated and owned by CaseWare Cloud Ltd., and never shared with other parties, including Amazon, or employees of CaseWare Cloud Ltd. The same level of encryption is applied to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>data transferred to and from CaseWare Cloud</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>data at rest</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>backup data</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="data-backup">Is my data backed up?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Your data is backed up daily, and each backup is maintained for 80 days.</p>
        <p>CaseWare Cloud utilizes Amazon Glacier for backup storage. Glacier data is specific to a single region and it is not automatically replicated anywhere else. If you have legal requirements that your data must be stored geographically in one region, that data will only be stored there.</p>
