        <h1>CaseWare Cloud apps</h1>
        <p>Cloud offers four apps that expand its functionality: <b>Time</b>, <b>Expense</b>, <b>Billing</b>, and <b>Analysis</b>. These apps are available as soon as you activate your account, and offer your organization a number of advantages.</p>
        <h2>The apps</h2>

        </p>
        <h3>Time</h3>
        <p>The Time app tracks time spent working on engagements with a series of modifiable entries. You can create these entries manually or automatically, both on desktop and mobile platforms. Mobile support makes recording time entries outside of the office both easier and more accurate.</p>
        <h3>Expense</h3>
        <p>The Expense app creates entries for billable and non-billable expenses, and allows you to add receipts associated with those expenses. Mobile support means you can enter expenses sooner and keep more accurate records. </p>
        <h3>Billing</h3>
        <p>The Billing app prepares both WIP and final invoices based on entries created the Time and Expense apps. Once prepared, invoices can be sent to clients directly from the app, or printed and sent by mail. </p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>The Analysis app generates both detailed and summary reports based on data collected through Cloud. These reports can be based on time entries, expenses, invoices, or WIP, and provide the information required to track your work on a given engagement and best decide how to allocate resources. </p>
        <h2>The future of CaseWare Cloud apps</h2>
        <p>CaseWare is committed to making new apps available to Cloud users. As part of this commitment, app development will soon open to other developers. Creating an app ecosystem means the number of apps available to users will continually expand, and customizing your Cloud account to meet your organizationâ€™s needs will be even easier.</p>
