        <p>There are several considerations when a staff member leaves your organization either temporarily or permanently. As an administrator, you will need to decide if it is more appropriate to <b>deactivate</b> or <b>delete</b> their Cloud account, and you will need to reassign their work and transfer ownership of any Cloud documents that are associated with them.</p>
        <h2 id="Deactivating-staff-or-contacts">Deactivating staff or contacts</h2>
        <p><b>Deactivating</b> a user prevents them from logging into Cloud, but keeps their profile in the system and preserves their files, activities, and discussions. You may want to deactivate a user if they are going on extended leave.</p>
        <p><b>To deactivate a staff member or contact:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">

                <p>Go to the <b>Staff</b> or <b>Contacts</b> page.</p>

        <p>You have deactivated the user. They will no longer be able to long into Cloud.</p>
        <h2 id="Deleting-staff-or-contacts">Deleting staff or contacts</h2>
        <p><b>Deleting</b> a user removes them from the system, and prevents them from logging into Cloud, as well as accessing any SmartSync-enabled Working Papers files.
