        <h1>Gathering client info</h1>
        <p>You have completed all of the steps in the engagement acceptance stage: </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>completed the client acceptance and quality acceptance checklist documents</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>reviewed and finalized the draft version of the engagement letter</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>sent a copy of the engagement letter to the client to be signed</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>added the signed engagement letter to the engagement file</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now you will want to import the client’s trial balance to proceed with your review.</p>

        <h2>Submit the PBC Document Requests query</h2>
        <p>Open the Documents page, and in the <b>Fieldwork</b> section, open <b>2-930 PBC Document Requests - Engagements Subsequent to Initial Year</b>. This query document includes a list of file requests for files and information that could be relevant for a review engagement.</p>
        <p>Since there may be documents not relevant for this client or engagement, you can edit the query to make it more manageable for both you and the client. At the top of the document, select the <b>Edit icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/edit-icon-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-query-document-requests-select-edit-1134x250.png" />
        </p>
        <p>All of the sections in this query document are now available for editing. You can select a text area to update the request description, you can use the <b>Reorder icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/query-move-procedure-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) to move a procedure to a different place in the document, or you can use the <b>Delete icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/query-delete-procedure-12x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) to remove individual procedures or entire sections.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note</b>: When you delete a procedure or a section in a query, a confirmation dialog is displayed warning you that deleted procedures cannot be reinstated. If you remove content from a query by mistake, you can add a new copy of the original query to your engagement file on the Documents page.</p>
        <p>Make the following changes to the document:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>In the text area of the first procedure, enter <b>Chart of accounts</b> and a delivery date under the Summary of requested items. Remove the other numbered lines from the summary.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>In the <b>Current Year Transactions section</b>, in the text area of the <b>Chart of accounts</b> procedure, replace the <b>insert date</b> placeholder text with the client’s year-end date.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you are done, close editing mode by selecting the <b>Edit icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/edit-icon-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) again. Change the status to <b>Open</b> to display the Open Query dialog. Choose a due date, and enter the following custom email message:</p>
        <p><i>Please attach the chart of accounts for this year's review.</i>
        </p>
        <p>Select <b>OK</b> to open the query.</p>
        <p>Once the client attaches their file, you can review the trial balance before accepting the procedure. In the query, you can select the file name to open it.</p>

        <div class="note inline">

        </div>
        <p>Once you have confirmed that client’s file contains the trial balance information that you need, you can accept the procedures and complete the query. Select the Responded icon beside the Chart of accounts procedure and choose <b>Accept</b>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When you go back to the Documents page, you will see that the trial balance file has been added to the Permanent File section under <b>Current Year Transactions</b>.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Import the trial balance</h2>
        <p>Now that you have added the client’s trial balance file to the engagement file, you can import the trial balance information. From the top menu, open the <b>Trial Balance</b> page.</p>
        <p class="image">

        </p>
        <p>Select the <b>Import button</b>, then choose <b>Excel or CSV Import</b>. A new dialog is displayed prompting you to select a file by either dragging and dropping it from your desktop, by browsing for it, or by selecting a file in the engagement.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When you choose <b>Select file from engagement</b>, you will be able to select the Excel file that you added to the engagement file from the client query. Select the file from this dialog, and the Column Mapping dialog is displayed next.</p>

        </p>
        <p>For each column in the import file, select a field to import the values in that column to. For the sample file, import the columns as follows:</p>
        <table>
            <col style="width: 50%" />
            <col style="width: 50%" />

                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>At the bottom of the dialog, select the <b>Import button</b>.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-trial-balance-import-result-1134x492.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The contents of the trial balance file are now imported into the engagement file. The net income is displayed at the top corner of the window, and if the trial balance is out of balance, warnings are displayed at the top of the relevant columns.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Modify the trial balance</h2>
        <p>When you import a trial balance, OnPoint will map as many of the accounts as it can, but in some cases, you may need to evaluate accounts and assign them manually. At the top of the page, in the trial balance menu, notice that the <b>Assign accounts</b> button now has a number in parentheses.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-trial-balance-assign-accounts-button-1134x200.png" />
        </p>
        <p>This indicates that one account is not currently assigned to a group. Select the button to open the Assign accounts page.</p>
        <p>On this page, one account, <b>Cash</b>, is displayed in the Unassigned column.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-assign-accounts-unassigned-cash-1134x488.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select this account to move it into the Selected Accounts section. When you do, OnPoint displays a few group suggestions based on the account name, “Cash”. To assign it to the <b>Cash</b> group, select the green <b>Assign</b> icon that is displayed beside the suggestion.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-assign-accounts-suggestions-1134x422.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You can also drag and drop accounts on this page to assign them to a new group. In the Groups column, the account <b>Bank - Savings</b> is currently grouped under <b>Cash and Cash Equivalents</b>, but <b>Bank - Checking</b> is grouped one level lower, under <b>Cash</b>. Select <b>Bank - Savings</b> and drag it one line down, to the <b>Cash</b> group. When the group line is displayed with a green background, you can drop the account to assign it to the new group.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-assign-accounts-drag-and-drop-1134x470.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Return to the trial balance page. You can see that your changes are reflected here, as there are now three accounts in the <b>Cash</b> group.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-trial-balance-assign-accounts-result-1134x400.png" />
        </p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Annotate the trial balance</h2>
        <p>While you are reviewing the trial balance, you can annotate accounts. From the trial balance menu, select the <b>View button</b>.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-trial-balance-view-options-1134x371.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You can select different options here to change the information displayed on the trial balance. First, select <b>Variance</b>. You will see a new column that displays the variance between the final balance in the current period and the final balance from the prior period.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-trial-balance-view-variance-1134x400.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Notice that for your sample trial balance, there is no <b>Prior</b> value for the <b>Bank - Savings</b> account. You ask the client about this, and they inform you that the cash in the savings account came from sales that happened very late at the end of the year. You can add an annotation to include this information directly on the trial balance.</p>
        <p>Select the <b>Add annotation button</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/annotation-add-16x16.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) on the <b>Bank - Savings</b> line. A new dialog is displayed.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-trial-balance-add-annotation-dialogs-840x465.png" />
        </p>
        <p>When you select this option, you can choose a purpose for your annotation, link it to a document or to an adjustment, and add a note to describe the reason for the annotation. You may also see a separate area where you can choose from several annotations suggested by OnPoint PCR.</p>
        <p>For this annotation, select <b>Variance</b> for the purpose, and for the note section enter “<b>Late sales at end of year.</b>” Save your annotation.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-trial-balance-add-annotation-result-1240x474.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Now the trial balance displays an icon for the annotation type, and it includes the description from the note.</p>
