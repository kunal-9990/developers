        <h1>Engagement acceptance</h1>
        <p>You have completed all the steps for the initial setup of your OnPoint PCR engagement: </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>created the engagement file</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>assigned staff members to the engagement</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>shared the engagement with your client contact</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>reviewed the engagement properties</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now you are ready to begin working in the engagement file itself. The next step is to complete the pre-engagement acceptance procedures. </p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>The Documents page</h2>
        <p>When you open your OnPoint PCR engagement, you are automatically brought to the Documents page. This page is the starting point for almost all of the work that you will do on the engagement.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-documents-page-beginning-1134x548.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Your engagement documents are grouped by their place in the engagement workflow. There are four large categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Client Acceptance and Planning</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Fieldwork</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Financial Statements and Wrap-up</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Permanent File</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Three of the sections have a progress indicator that measures how close that part of the engagement is to being completed. The progress indicator displays a percentage that indicates how many of the documents in the section have been signed off on by a reviewer.</p>
        <p>In the Permanent File section, you can add supporting documents for the engagement. These documents will be carried forward when you create next year’s engagement for this client.</p>
        <p>When you first start a new engagement, there are only a few documents visible on the page, but OnPoint PCR content is displayed dynamically. As you complete procedures and sign off documents, the next documents you will need are added to the documents page.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Complete the Client Acceptance and Continuance document</h2>
        <p>Open the <b>Client Acceptance and Continuance</b> document. In this document, you will provide initial information about the client and the engagement type.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-client-acceptance-blank-1134x686.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The Client Acceptance and Continuance document is a <b>checklist</b> document. Each checklist document contains a set of <b>procedures</b> that the engagement preparer can input answers for. Most of the engagement work in OnPoint PCR engagements is completed in checklists.</p>
        <p>At the top of this document you will see client data. If you entered some of this information in Cloud, on the client’s entity profile, then that information is automatically pulled into the Client Data section. Select the gray <b>Sign off</b> checkbox for this section.</p>
        <div class="note inline">
            <p><b>Note</b>: If you need to make any corrections, select the <b>Edit icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/edit-icon-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) for the section and enter the client data manually.</p>
            <p class="image">
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/client-data-edit.png" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>As you complete procedures in this checklist, other documents will be added to your engagement file. Select the <b>Documents icon</b>(<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/documents-sidebar-19x15.png" />) on the side panel.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-client-acceptance-select-documents-side-panel-1134x530.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The panel expands, and you can see a list of all of the documents in the file. Note that there is one document under the <b>Client Acceptance and Planning</b> section.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-client-acceptance-documents-side-panel-before-procedure-1134x420.png" />
        </p>
        <p>For the first procedure, select <b>Review</b> for the engagement type. The procedure is automatically signed off with your name and the date, and notice that three documents have been added on the side panel.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-client-acceptance-documents-side-panel-after-procedure-1134x460.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Based on the engagement type you selected in the first procedure, OnPoint automatically adds corresponding documents to your engagement file. As you enter responses for all of the procedures in this document, the documents and procedures in your engagement will be updated to give you exactly the content that you need.</p>
        <p>Complete the procedures in the <b>Client Acceptance and Continuance</b> document.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><b>Your engagement letter has been prepared and is available here as <span style="color: #1e90ff;">1-220a Review Engagement Letter (Draft)</span> or in the folder Client Acceptance and Planning.</b>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Select the document name to open the draft engagement letter.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Complete the engagement letter</h2>
        <p>The first two checklist documents that you have completed outline the basic engagement information. The draft version of your engagement letter has automatically been generated based on your responses in those checklists.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-engagement-letter-draft-1134x750.png" />
        </p>
        <p>At the top of the letter, you will see the <b>guidance</b> section. This section contains information about the contents of the letter below, and it includes instructions for finalizing the draft. Guidance is displayed by default, but it is not included when you print the letter. You can hide the guidance section by selecting the toggle at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>The engagement letter draft uses red text to indicate an area where you have to enter information specific to your engagement. Review the letter and update any sections with placeholder text.</p>
        <p>For example, the first text area contains firm information. The firm name and address are populated automatically based on values from your firm profile on Cloud, but there is red text here indicating that you should insert firm letterhead.</p>
        <p>To edit a text area in the letter, select the <b>Edit icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/edit-icon-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) at the right-hand side of the section.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-engagement-letter-select-edit-1134x340.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The text area will be displayed with a gray background, and you can select the text area to change the content. Select the line that says <b>[Insert Firm Letterhead]</b> and then from the text editing menu, select the <b>Insert Image icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/insert-image-14x12.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-engagement-letter-insert-image-1134x432.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the Image dialog, select <b>Choose File</b>. Find the image file for your firm letterhead, and then select <b>OK</b>.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-engagement-letter-image-dialog-660x324.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The image is added to your text area. Once you have finished editing the area, select the <b>Edit icon</b>(<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/edit-icon-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) again to save your changes.</p>
        <p>You will also find pull-down menus embedded in parts of the letter. Like the red text, these menus are placeholders for information that you need to add to the letter.</p>
        <p>For example, in the second text area, you will see a pull-down menu that says <b>Today’s Date</b>.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-engagement-letter-pull-down-menu-1134x450.png" />
        </p>
        <p>When you select this menu, a calendar is displayed. Select a date from the calendar menu, and the date area in the letter displays the chosen date. Note that though the pull-down menu’s background is no longer visible, you can still select the date to display the calendar menu and change your date.</p>
        <p>Review the rest of the letter draft, select values for each of the pull-down menus, and replace the red placeholder text with content specific for your engagement. Once you have finished editing the document and have inserted another image with your firm’s signature, you will be ready to configure the print settings.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Configure the print settings for the engagement letter</h2>
        <p>You have filled in all the placeholders in your letter with real content, entering dates and client names and adding in any mandated content for letters in your firm. Next, you should add a header to your letter that includes your firm name, and you should set the page size for your letter.</p>
        <p>Select the <b>Print Settings</b> button to display the Print Settings dialog.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-engagement-letter-print-settings-blank-1134x670.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the Header text area to expand it and display the text editing menu. From the menu, select the <b>Insert Formula</b> icon (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/text-field-edit-insert-formula-16x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />). The Data Link dialog is displayed. Select the Firm properties tab, and then select the Firm name to add it to your header.</p>
        <p>You can set a specific page size by choosing it from the Page Size pull-down menu. Set the page size to <b>Letter</b>.</p>
        <p>Note that you can also change the following settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">change the page orientation to landscape (the default is <b>Portrait</b>)</li>
            <li value="2">adjust the margin width</li>
            <li value="3">include or exclude a document’s table of contents from the page numbering</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have changed your print settings, select <b>Save</b>. You can select the <b>Print</b> button at the top of the letter to see a sample of your engagement letter with the header included.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Send the engagement letter to the client</h2>
        <p>Now that the draft of your engagement letter is ready, you need the client’s signature in order to proceed with the engagement. You can send your draft directly to your client in OnPoint PCR by using a query.</p>
        <p>A <b>query</b> is a document that you can use to communicate directly with the client. You can use queries for a number of things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><i>Request for information</i> - send questions to the client.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><i>Document request</i> - ask the client to upload one or more files.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p><i>Send deliverables</i> - send documents to the client to sign and return.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your client has a contact account in Cloud, they can sign in and respond directly on queries.</p>
        <p>Open the <b>Documents</b> page. Notice that there are more documents displayed here based on the questions that we responded to in the acceptance documents. In the Client Acceptance and Planning section, under <b>1-220a Review Engagement Letter (Draft)</b>, you will see a query document named <b>1-220b Review Engagement Letter (Query to Client)</b>.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-documents-page-engagement-letter-query-1134x646.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Open this query. The query has one procedure for the client: they are asked to review and sign the attached draft of the engagement letter.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-query-engagement-letter-new-1134x420.png" />
        </p>
        <p>At the top of the document, the status for this query is set to <b>Draft</b>. To submit the query to the client, change the status to <b>Open</b>. The Open Query dialog is displayed.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-query-engagement-letter-open-query-dialog-1134x460.png" />
        </p>
        <p>First, select a due date from the calendar menu. Next, assign the query to one of your client contacts. Deselect the checkbox beside <b>Assign to all contacts</b>. Select the contact search field that is displayed below it and then choose one of the contacts from the quick list. Finally, enter the following custom email message:</p>
        <p><i>Please review the attached engagement letter, sign it, and return it to us. If you notice any problems in the letter, please inform us at once.</i>
        </p>
        <p>Select <b>OK</b> to open the query. This also automatically updates the status of the engagement file to <b>Waiting on Queries</b>.</p>
        <p>The client will receive an email notifying them that there is an item in Cloud that requires their attention. When they log in, they will see your request under <b>My Work</b>.</p>

        <p>The client can download a copy of the PDF letter, review it, add their signature, and upload the signed document back to the same query. They can also add comments to the query, and these comments will be visible to your firm members in the engagement file.</p>
        <p>Once they have responded to all of the tasks on the query, they can mark the query as <b>Responded</b>. This updates the document status in the engagement file, and it also automatically updates the status of the engagement file to <b>Queries Ready</b>. Your client contacts can no longer see a query that has been marked as <b>Responded</b> on their Overview page, but they can still see the query on the <b>Activities</b> page.</p>

        <h2>Accept the signed engagement letter</h2>
        <p>When you review the query, you can see that the client has responded to the procedure, and you can either accept or decline the response. To accept the query, change the query status at the top of the document to <b>Complete</b>.</p>

        <p>When you accept the query, the signed letter is attached to the file, replacing the placeholder that was on the Documents page. The query will be locked to prevent any further editing.</p>
