        <h1>Starting an engagement</h1>
        <p>At the beginning of a new client engagement, you will need to create a new OnPoint PCR engagement file. Engagement files are created and hosted on CaseWare Cloud (for more information about CaseWare Cloud, visit https://www.casewarecloud.com). </p>
        <p>In this chapter, we will cover the following tasks:</p>

        <h2>Create a new engagement file</h2>
        <p>When you are ready to begin work on a client engagement, the first thing you will do is create the new engagement file. In CaseWare Cloud, you can create your engagement file in the client entity, set key dates and budgets, and assign staff members to the file.</p>

            <p>Your new engagement is created. If you select <b>All</b> on the side panel to view all of the engagements for your organization, you will see the engagement added to the list.</p>
            <div class="pagebreak">
            </div>
            <h2>Assign staff to the engagement</h2>
            <p>Once you have created the engagement file, you can assign staff members to work on it. Select the engagement to expand it. You can see engagement information such as budgets and key dates.</p>

            <p>You can assign staff members to the engagement from here. Select the <b>Assigned</b> field (notice that no staff members have been assigned to this file as yet). A <b>Manage Team</b> popup is displayed. You can enter the name of one of your team members, and when you select their profile, you can assign the staff member as a preparer, a reviewer, or a second reviewer.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Share the file with your client contact</h2>
            <p>One of the benefits of OnPoint PCR is that you can easily collaborate with your client while working on the engagement. To enable this, your client needs to have a contact account on CaseWare Cloud, and you need to assign the appropriate role for this contact to access the engagement.</p>
            <p>In Cloud, go to the detail page for the client’s entity. At the bottom of the details, in the Files section, you will see the new engagement for your client.</p>
            <p class="image">
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/cloud-client-entity-details-page-with-contact-1134x790.png" />
            </p>
            <p>Select the file to open the detail dialog, and select the <b>Share icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/Share-16x16.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>
            <p class="image">
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/cloud-file-details-select-share-1134x284.png" />
            </p>
            <p>In the Share dialog, enable contact access and then grant your client contact the <b>Contact - Editor</b> role.</p>
            <p class="image">
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/cloud-share-dialog-share-with-contact-705x628.png" />
            </p>
            <p>This will enable your client to collaborate with your firm staff on the engagement file. They cannot open the file itself, but they will be able to see discussions and tasks, and they will be able to respond to client requests.</p>

                <p><b>Flag a second reviewer</b> - you can enable a second set of review sign-offs for the documents in the engagement. You would normally do this only once a first round of reviews is complete.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p><b>Lock down the file</b> - you can lock down the engagement file once all engagement work is finalized.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Enter a job number and verify that your client’s year end date is correct, then save your changes.</p>
