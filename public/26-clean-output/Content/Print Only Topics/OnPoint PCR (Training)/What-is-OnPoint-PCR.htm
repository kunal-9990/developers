        <h1>What is OnPoint PCR?</h1>
        <p>CaseWareCloud OnPoint is a comprehensive, cloud-based audit engagement solution for small- and mid-sized firms, featuring guided client onboarding and continuous optimization using the latest methodology from the AICPA, and offering real-time collaboration with your colleagues and clients. It combines CaseWare’s cloud platform, AICPA guidance, and distribution from CPA.com.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>CaseWareCloud OnPoint PCR will guide you through preparations, compilations and reviews. As you set up a client file, the first question you will be asked is the type of engagement (profile).  The software will automatically populate the client file with the checklists needed to complete the engagement based upon the answers to engagement set up questions. The accountant always has the ability to further modify the checklists adding additional steps if needed. Each of the engagement profiles (described below) includes procedures to meet the requirements of AR­C 60 General Principles for Engagements Performed in Accordance with SSARS.</p>

        <p>The practice aids have been designed for a small and medium-sized (SME) non-public company, and do not address the wide range of circumstances or specific industry issues that may exist for a particular client or groups of clients (such as those operating in a specialized industry, government or non-profit organization, complex IT environments, etc.). Consequently, the forms should always be tailored to address the known facts and circumstances of each engagement.</p>
