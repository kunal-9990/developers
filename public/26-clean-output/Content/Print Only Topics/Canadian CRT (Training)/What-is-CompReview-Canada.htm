The software will automatically populate the client file with the checklists needed to complete the engagement based upon the answers to engagement set up questions. The accountant or auditor has the ability to further modify the checklists adding additional steps if needed. Each of the engagement profiles includes procedures to meet the requirements of the relevant regulatory standards.</p>

        <h3>About this guide</h3>
        <p>The practice aids in this guide have been designed for a small and medium-sized (SME) non-public company, and do not address the wide range of circumstances or specific industry issues that may exist for a particular client or groups of clients (such as those operating in a specialized industry, government or non-profit organization, complex IT environments, etc.). Consequently, the forms should always be tailored to address the known facts and circumstances of each engagement.</p>
