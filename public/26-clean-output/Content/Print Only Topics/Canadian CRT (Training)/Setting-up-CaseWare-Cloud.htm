        <h1>Setting up CaseWare Cloud</h1>
        <p>Before you can start work on any Review and Compilation – Canada engagements, you need to set up the new CaseWare Cloud portal for your organization. CaseWare offers a Getting Started guide that can walk you through the common setup tasks, but for the purposes of this training, there are three things that you will need to do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">set up workspaces in CaseWare Cloud for each of your clients</li>
            <li value="2">create accounts for your staff members</li>
            <li value="3">create accounts for your clients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This chapter will walk you through the process for completing these setup steps. Once these steps are complete, you will be ready to create a Review and Compilation – Canada engagement.</p>
        <h3>Create a new entity</h3>
        <p>An <b>entity</b> is a workspace that you can use to organize and collaborate on your engagement files from a single location for a client. When your organization is first beginning to use Cloud, you will need to create a new entity for each client.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note</b>: The instructions below explain the process for adding an individual client entity. You can also import a list of your clients in order to create all of your client entities at once. For more information, refer to CaseWare’s online help.</p>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Entities</b>. This takes you to the Entities page.</p>
        <p>Select <b>New</b>, and then select <b>Clients</b>. The Create Entity dialog is displayed.</p>
        <p>For each of the sections below, enter the following information:</p>

        <p>Once you have finished entering all of the relevant information for your client, select <b>Save</b>. The client entity is created, and you can see it added to the list on the Entities page.</p>
        <h3>Create accounts for your staff members</h3>
        <p>Once you have created entities for each of your clients, you will be ready to grant access to Cloud to other staff members in your organization. You can create a new account for each staff member who will need to collaborate on your engagements.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note</b>: The instructions below explain the process for adding individual staff members. You can also import a list of your staff members in order to create all of their user profiles at once. For more information, refer to CaseWare’s online help.</p>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Staff</b>. This takes you to the Staff page.</p>
        <p>Select <b>New</b>, and then under Add, select <b>Staff</b>. The Add Staff dialog is displayed. Just as you saw when creating an entity, there are different property groups where you will enter information about the new account.</p>
        <p style="font-size:130%;"><b>General</b>
        </p>
        <p>Enter an email address and a first and last name for the new staff member. The email address will be the username for their account, and they will log into Cloud with it.</p>
        <p>The other fields on this page are optional.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <p style="font-size:130%;"><b>Password</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can choose how the password for the new account will be set:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Set by User</b> - the staff member will set their own password when they first log in. Cloud sends an email with instructions on how to log in to the portal.</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Auto Generated</b> - a random password is chosen by Cloud. Cloud does not send an email to the staff member, so you will need to provide them with the login page URL, their user ID, and their password.</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Set</b> - you choose a password for the staff member. Again, Cloud does not send an email, so you will need to provide them with their login information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Leave the password option as <b>Set by User</b>.</p>
        <p style="font-size:130%;"><b>Groups</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can assign the staff member’s account to one or more staff groups. If you create groups in Cloud, you can specify permissions and access levels for members of that group, and then any accounts that you add as group members automatically inherit those settings.</p>
        <p>CaseWare Cloud only includes the <b>All Staff</b> staff group by default, and any staff members are automatically included in the group, so you won’t have to do anything in this section right now.</p>
        <p style="font-size:130%;"><b>System-Wide Roles</b>
        </p>
        <p>When you grant one or more system-wide roles to a staff member, they gain a set of access rights that are applied to all of the content in Cloud. For example, if you grant the system-wide <b>Viewer</b> role to your staff member, they can see all of the entities in your organization and can view all files and engagements in those entities. System-wide roles are the easiest way to set the access rights for staff members in your organization.</p>
        <p>Grant this staff member the system-wide <b>Editor</b> role. This will enable them to view all of the content in Cloud, and it will give them the ability to make changes while working on that content.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <p style="font-size:130%;"><b>Apps</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can grant access to apps on Cloud to your staff member. You can grant the staff member the ability to view engagements for an app and the ability to create new engagements or files for it.</p>
        <p>Note that by default, the <b>All Staff</b> group includes the ability to view and create engagements for all of the Cloud apps. This simplifies access, but if you needed to control access to some apps more tightly, you could remove some of those permissions from the global group. This would enable you to pick and choose which staff members should be able to work with certain apps.</p>
        <p style="font-size:130%;"><b>Standard Hours</b>
        </p>
        <p>The settings for Staff Standard Hours are only applicable to your organization if you use the CaseWareCloud Time app to handle time and expense entries. Leave this section set to <b>Organization standard hours</b>.</p>
        <p>Once you have finished entering all of the information for your staff member’s new account, select <b>Save</b>. They will receive a welcome email from Cloud notifying them that their account has been created and instructing them on how to log in.</p>
        <h3>Create an account for your client</h3>
        <p>One of the major benefits of Compilation and Review is that you can collaborate directly with your clients on engagements. In order for your clients to access their engagement file, you need to set up a contact account for them on Cloud.</p>
        <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Contacts</b>. This takes you to the Contacts page.</p>
        <p>Select <b>New</b>, and then under Add, select <b>Contact</b>. The Add Contact dialog is displayed.</p>
        <p style="font-size:130%;"><b>General</b>
        </p>
        <p>Enter a first and last name and an email address for your client contact. In the <b>Entity</b> field, select the client entity that you created earlier. Once you have selected the client entity, select the <b>Contact - Entity Collaborator</b> role to set the access level for this account. The entity collaborator role enables your client to create discussions, tasks, and file requests on Cloud, and it also enables them to collaborate on engagements for Compilation and Review.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <p style="font-size:130%;"><b>Password</b>
        </p>
        <p>The same password options that you had when creating your staff accounts are also available here. Leave the password option as <b>Set by User</b>.</p>
        <p style="font-size:130%;"><b>Groups</b>
        </p>
        <p>Contact groups work the same way that staff groups do on Cloud. The only contact group in Cloud by default is <b>All Contacts</b>, and your client will automatically be part of that group.</p>
        <p style="font-size:130%;"><b>Apps</b>
        </p>
        <p>Just like the <b>All Staff</b> group, the <b>All Contacts</b> group automatically grants client contacts the ability to view engagements or files for all app types in Cloud. Review the permissions and make sure that your contact can view Review and Compilation – Canada engagements.</p>
        <p>Once you have finished entering all of the information for your client contact’s account, select <b>Save</b>. They will receive a welcome email from Cloud notifying them that their account has been created and instructing them on how to log in.</p>
