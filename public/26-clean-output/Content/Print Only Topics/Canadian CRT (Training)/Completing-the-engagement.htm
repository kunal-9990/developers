            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Financial-reporting-framework-documents.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the <b>Financial reporting framework</b> section, Review and Compilation – Canada lists the checklist documents that must be completed to verify compliance with ASPE, assuming this reporting framework was specified in the <b>Optimizer</b>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>For each document, select the appropriate the sample notes. respond to all checklist procedures, and perform the sign off.</p>
        <h3>Finalizing the financial statements</h3>
        <p>At the conclusion of the engagement, you will create a financial statements document for the client where you explain your findings and present a conclusion. Review and Compilation – Canada has a built-in template that will make it easier for you to prepare the financial statements.</p>
        <p>On the Documents page, in the <b>Issuing the report</b> section, open the <b>6-10 Report transmittal</b> document. In this document, you'll specify the distribution methods for the report, authorize it for release, and set milestone dates such as the release and final assembly dates.</p>
        <p>Open <b>6-20 Financial statements</b>.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Financial-statements-document.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The <b>Financial statements</b> document includes the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Title page</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Customize the financial statements</h3>
        <p>Most of the content in the financial statements document is already populated for you. The content in the review report is based on your answers to the questions in the engagement planning documents. Groups and accounts on the financial statements tables are taken from the trial balance.</p>
        <p>However, you will need to make other changes to customize the financial statements for your client.</p>
        <p>As you saw in the engagement letter, the financial statements include pulldown menus. These must be used to complete the statement in some sections.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Financial-statements-menus.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once you have made all changes that you need to, select the Edit icon again to save your changes.</p>
        <h4>Edit a financial statement table</h4>
        <p>While you cannot change the specific accounts and groups that are included in a financial statement table, you can make some changes to the content that is displayed.</p>
        <h4>Enter information into a financial statement table</h4>
        <p>Many of the tables in the financial statements are populated automatically. The information in them is pulled straight from the trial balance, to make financial statement preparation easier for you. However, you will also likely need to enter some additional information yourself.</p>
        <p>Some of the lines in the financial statements are <b>input rows</b>. In an input row, you can enter amounts into the fields, and these amounts will be included in final calculations for the table.</p>
        <p>For example, select <b>Edit</b> and scroll down to the Statement of Cash Flows.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Financial-statements-edit-cash-flows.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Normally, rows with no values are hidden from the standard view of a table, but in edit mode you can see all of the input rows, such as the <b>Other non-cash income (expense)</b> row. Once you enter any financial data into an input row, that row will be displayed in the statement of cash flows.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note</b>: If you want to enter a different amount in a row that already has automatic values, select the <b>gear icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/dynamic-table-row-settings-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) at the end of the row and then select <b>Override calculated balances</b>.</p>
        <h4>Expand a line in the financial statements</h4>
        <p>Many of the financial statement tables collapse accounts into their groupings by default. You can expand lines in the financial statement to give more details about some areas of the engagement file.</p>
        <p>For example, in the Balance Sheet, the Long-Term Assets section displays totals for two areas: <i>Property, plant and equipment</i> and <i>Other long-term assets</i>. You decide that you want to give the client more information about the <i>Property, plant and equipment</i> group.</p>
        <p>Beside the group name, there is an <b>Expand lines icon</b>(<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/expand-lines-icon-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />). Select this icon.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Balance-sheet-property-group.png" />
        </p>
        <p>All of the lines under your selected group are now displayed, and you can see the amounts for each different category under <i>Property, plant and equipment - Cost</i>, along with the amount for <i>Accumulated amortization of property, plant and equipment</i>..</p>
        <p>You then decide that you do not need to show the client all of the subcategories under <i>Property, plant and equipment</i>. Select the <b>Collapse lines icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/collapse-lines-icon-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) beside this group.</p>
        <p>You have now collapsed the subgroups.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note</b>: If you want to see more details about a balance on the financial statement without changing a table, you can select the line with that balance to drill down and display more details.</p>
        <p class="note inline">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Balance-sheet-cash-equivalents-details.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>Modify the description of a financial statement line</h4>
        <p>To change the descriptions of lines in the financial statements, you will need to change the document settings. At the top of the page, select <b>Edit</b>. Select the <b>Settings</b> button, then enable the option that says “Allow override of line”.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Financial-statement-enable-line-edit.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once you have selected the <b>Done</b> button to save this change, you will be able to edit the description for any line item in the document.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Financial-statements-line-editable.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Notes to the financial statements</h3>
        <p>The <b>Notes to the Financial Statements</b> section is at the bottom of the financial statements document. If you need to provide any supplementary information about the results of your engagement, you can add that information here.</p>
        <p>Each <b>note</b> can include a <b>guidance</b> section with information on any changes that you might need to make to it as the preparer. They also typically have one or more <b>text areas</b> that contain explanations relevant for the note.</p>
        <p>Some of the notes in your engagement may also include a <b>dynamic table</b>. Dynamic tables contain specific lines from the trial balance or custom rows where you can input your own data. These tables are intended to highlight specific parts of the trial balance or to support your conclusions.</p>
        <p>If required, you can also amend this section by adding notes.</p>
        <p><b>To add a note to the financial statements</b>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Select the <b>Edit</b> button in the financial statements menu.</p>
                <p class="image">
                    <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/FirmSettings/Images/financial-statements-edit-button-1134x340.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Scroll to the bottom of the document, and in the bottom note section, select <b>+ New section</b>, then choose <b>+ Note</b>.</p>
                <p class="image">
                    <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-financial-statements-add-note-1000x366.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select the placeholder text <b>Note title</b> and enter the title for your new note. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have added a note to the financial statements. New notes are empty by default, so you will need to add sections to the note to display your information. Next, you will add a text area to your note to introduce the dynamic table:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Under the note, select <b>+ New section</b>, then choose <b>+ Text Area</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Select the gray text area, then enter the following</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have added a description for the contents of the new note.</p>
        <p>Now, to add the balance information for the property and equipment account groups, you will need to add a dynamic table. You will add a blank dynamic table section, and you will edit the layout in the table editing interface, adding a row, expanding the accounts under it, and hiding one extra row.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Under the text area, select <b>+ New section</b>, then choose <b>+ Dynamic Table</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>In the new Dynamic Table section, select the <b>Gear icon</b>(<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/dynamic-table-row-settings-15x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) in the section heading, and choose <b>Edit layout</b>.</p>

        <p>You have added a dynamic table to your note. When you scroll to the bottom of the financial statements document, you will see the note with all its new content.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Add a cross reference to a line</h3>
        <p>If a line in the financial statement table requires more explanation, you can add a cross reference to the line that links to one of the notes to the financial statements.</p>
        <p>For example, you decide that you want to provide a breakdown of the <i>Property, Plant and Equipment</i> group, but you do not want to display it on the balance sheet. You can link a line in the balance sheet to the <i>Property, plant and Equipment</i> note.</p>
        <p>At the top of the balance sheet, select <b>Edit</b>.</p>

            <p>Some notes contain placeholder content that must be replaced with engagement-specific content. You can edit any note by selecting the <b>Edit</b> button at the top of the page. Once the note is in editing mode, you can make changes to each section inside it.</p>
            <p>For example, in section <b>a</b> of the first note, <b>Summary of accounting policies</b>, you'll see a </p>

            <p>The subgroups, <b>Machinery and Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures</b> and <b>Leasehold Improvements</b> are all displayed, and a total row is added to the bottom of the table.</p>
            <p>Finally, at the end of the row for the <b>Property, Plant and Equipment</b> group that you expanded, select the <b>Ellipsis icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/Ellipsis-20x16.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) and choose <b>Hide row</b>.</p>
