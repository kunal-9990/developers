        <p>You have completed all of the steps in the engagement acceptance stage: </p>

        <h3>Complete the Client inquiries document</h3>
        <p>Open the Documents page, and in the <b>Planning</b> section, open <b>1-60 Client queries- Request for compilation documents and records</b>. This query document includes a list of file requests for files and information that could be relevant for a review engagement.</p>

        <h3>Modify the trial balance</h3>
        <p>When you import a trial balance, Review and Compilation – Canada will map as many of the accounts (and assign the appropriate GIFI codes, which will also be automatically transferred to the tax forms if you're performing a tax return) as it can, but in some cases, you may need to evaluate accounts and assign them manually. In this example, notice that the <b>Assign accounts</b> button now has a number in parentheses.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="/Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-trial-balance-assign-accounts-button-1134x200.png" />
        </p>
        <p>This indicates that one account is not currently assigned to a group. Select the button to open the Assign accounts page.</p>
        <p>On this page, one account, <b>Cash</b>, is displayed in the Unassigned column.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="/Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-assign-accounts-unassigned-cash-1134x488.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select an account to move it into the Selected Accounts section. When you do, Review and Compilation – Canada displays a few group suggestions based on the account name, “Cash”. To assign it to the <b>Cash</b> group, select the green <b>Assign</b> icon that is displayed beside the suggestion.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="/Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-assign-accounts-suggestions-1134x422.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You can also drag and drop accounts on this page to assign them to a new group. In this example, in the Groups column, the account <b>Bank - Savings</b> is currently grouped under <b>Cash and Cash Equivalents</b>, but <b>Bank - Checking</b> is grouped one level lower, under <b>Cash</b>. Select <b>Bank - Savings</b> and drag it one line down, to the <b>Cash</b> group. When the group line is displayed with a green background, you can drop the account to assign it to the new group.</p>

        <h3>Annotate the trial balance</h3>
        <p>While you are reviewing the trial balance, you can annotate accounts. From the trial balance menu, select the <b>View button</b>.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="/Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-trial-balance-view-options-1134x371.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You can select different options here to change the information displayed on the trial balance. First, select <b>Variance</b>. You will see a new column that displays the variance between the final balance in the current period and the final balance from the prior period.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="/Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-trial-balance-view-variance-1134x400.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Notice that in this example, there is no <b>Prior</b> value for the <b>Bank - Savings</b> account. You ask the client about this, and they inform you that the cash in the savings account came from sales that happened very late at the end of the year. You can add an annotation to include this information directly on the trial balance.</p>
        <p>Select the <b>Add annotation button</b> (<img src="/Resources/Icons/SE icons/annotation-add-16x16.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />) on the <b>Bank - Savings</b> line. A new dialog is displayed.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="/Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-trial-balance-add-annotation-dialogs-840x465.png" />
        </p>
        <p>When you select this option, you can choose a purpose for your annotation, link it to a document or to an adjustment, and add a note to describe the reason for the annotation. You may also see a separate area where you can choose from several annotations suggested by Review and Compilation – Canada.</p>
        <p>For this annotation, you select <b>Variance</b> for the purpose, and for the note section enter “<b>Late sales at end of year.</b>” and save your annotation.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Now the trial balance displays an icon for the annotation type, and it includes the description from the note.</p>
