        <h1>Engagement acceptance</h1>
        <p>You have completed all the steps for the initial setup of your Review and Compilation – Canada engagement: </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>created the engagement file</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>assigned staff members to the engagement</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>shared the engagement with your client contact</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>reviewed the engagement properties</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now you are ready to begin working in the engagement file itself. The next step is to complete the pre-engagement acceptance procedures. </p>
        <h3>The Documents page</h3>
        <p>When you open your Review and Compilation – Canada engagement, you are automatically brought to the Documents page. This page is the starting point for almost all of the work that you will do on the engagement.</p>
        <p>Your engagement documents are grouped by their place in the engagement workflow. There are four categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><b>Planning</b>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><b>Performing</b>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p><b>Conclusion</b>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p><b>Tax</b>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you first open your engagement, only the <b>Planning</b> section will be visible. Each section has a progress indicator that measures how close that part of the engagement is to being completed. The progress indicator displays a percentage that indicates how many of the documents in the section have been signed off on by a reviewer.</p>
        <p>When you first start a new engagement, there are only a few documents visible on the page, but Review and Compilation – Canada content is displayed dynamically. As you complete procedures and sign off documents, the next documents you will need are added to the documents page.</p>
        <h3>Complete the Optimizer document</h3>
        <p>Open the <b>0-10 Optimizer</b> document. In this document, you will provide initial information about the client and the engagement type.</p>
        <p>The Optimizer document is a <b>checklist</b> document. Each checklist document contains a set of <b>procedures</b> that the engagement preparer can input answers for. Most of the engagement work in Review and Compilation – Canada engagements is completed in checklists.</p>
        <p>As you complete procedures in this checklist, other documents will be added to your engagement file. Select the <b>Documents</b> icon (<img src="/Resources/Icons/SE icons/documents-sidebar-19x15.png" />) on the side panel.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Optimizer-document.png" alt="The Document Map icon in the Complation and Review interface." />
        </p>
        <p>As you continue to complete the checklist, the engagement will be populated with the appropriate documents. </p>
        <p>For example, when you select <b>Compilation</b> as the engagement type. Notice that two documents have been added on the side panel.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Compilation-new-documents.png" alt="The Documents list populates after you start to respond to questions in the Optimizer" />
        </p>
        <p>Complete the procedures in the <b>Optimizer</b> document as follows:</p>
        <table>
            <col style="width: 50%" />
            <col style="width: 50%" />

        </table>
        <p>Complete the remaining procedures as appropriate.</p>
        <p>Once you have completed the procedures, you can sign off on the document to indicate that it is complete. At the top of the document, select the <b>Sign Off</b> button, and then sign off the <b>Preparer</b> role.</p>
        <h3>Review and complete the engagement letter</h3>
        <p>Your Optimizer responses outline the basic engagement information. The draft version of your engagement letter has automatically been generated based on your responses, as you can see by opening the <b>300 Compilation engagement letter</b>.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Compilation-engagement-letter.png" />
        </p>
        <p>At the top of the letter, you will see the <b>Guidance</b> section. This section contains information about the contents of the letter below, and it includes instructions for finalizing the draft. Guidance is displayed by default, but it is not included when you print the letter. Selecting the Guidance toggle once collapses the guidance sections, while selecting it a second time hides the guidance sections completely, displaying the document as the client would see it.</p>
        <p>The firm logo is automatically pulled from your firm profile and placed at the top of the document, and the client firm's name and address are populated automatically based on values from the client firm's profile.</p>
        <h4>Edit the engagement letter</h4>
        <p>First, you will need to copy and paste your firm logo into the header area. Ensure that your firm logo is copied your to your clipboard, then select <b>Edit</b> and right-click in the header area.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Logo-paste-in-beta1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select <b>Paste</b> or press <b>Ctrl-V</b> to paste in your firm logo.</p>
        <p>The engagement letter draft uses blue pull-down menus to indicate areas where you have to enter information specific to your engagement. Review the letter and update any sections with placeholder text.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Compilation-letter-menu-boxes.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select each pull-down menu to choose from the available contacts associated with the client in Cloud. If the client has not yet been added to your Cloud firm as a contact, you can select <b>Add New Contact</b> to do so now.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Select-contact-options.png" />
        </p>
        <p> If an expected contact is not listed, edit their profile from the <b>People</b> page in Cloud and ensure they have the <b>Entity Collaborator</b> role. </p>
        <p>To edit the text of the letter, select the <b>Edit</b> button at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Compilation-letter-edit.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The text area will be displayed with a gray background, and you can select the text area to change the content. </p>
        <p>Once you have finished editing the area, select <b>Done</b> to save your changes.</p>
        <p>Review the rest of the letter draft and select values for each of the pull-down menus. Once you have finished editing the document, you will be ready to configure the print settings.</p>
        <h2>Configure the print settings for the engagement letter</h2>
        <p>You have filled in all the placeholders in your letter with real content, entering dates and client names and adding in any mandated content for letters in your firm. Next, you should add a header to your letter that includes your firm name, and you should set the page size for your letter.</p>
        <p>Select the <b>Print Settings</b> button to display the Print Settings dialog.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="/Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-engagement-letter-print-settings-blank-1134x670.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the Header text area to expand it and display the text editing menu. From the menu, select the <b>Insert Formula</b> icon (<img src="/Resources/Icons/SE icons/text-field-edit-insert-formula-16x15.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />). The Data Link dialog is displayed. Select the Firm properties tab, and then select the Firm name to add it to your header.</p>
        <p>You can set a specific page size by choosing it from the Page Size pull-down menu. Set the page size to <b>Letter</b>.</p>
        <p>Note that you can also change the following settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">change the page orientation to landscape (the default is <b>Portrait</b>)</li>
            <li value="2">adjust the margin width</li>
            <li value="3">include or exclude a document’s table of contents from the page numbering</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have changed your print settings, select <b>Save</b>. You can select the <b>Print</b> button at the top of the letter to see a sample of your engagement letter with the header included. Use this option to save a copy of the letter as a PDF.</p>
        <h2>Send the engagement letter to the client</h2>
        <p>Now that the draft of your engagement letter is ready, you need the client’s signature in order to proceed with the engagement. You can send your draft directly to your client in Review and Compilation – Canada by using a query.</p>
        <p>A <b>query</b> is a document that you can use to communicate directly with the client. You can use queries for a number of things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><i>Request for information</i> - send questions to the client.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><i>Document request</i> - ask the client to upload one or more files.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p><i>Send deliverables</i> - send documents to the client to sign and return.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your client has a contact account in Cloud, they can sign in and respond directly to queries.</p>
        <p>Open the <b>Documents</b> page.  In the <b>Perform the client acceptance/continuance</b> section, select <b>1-55 Client requests - Engagement letter</b>.</p>
        <p>The query has two procedures for the client: an <b>Initial request</b> and, if they are slow to respond, a <b>subsequent request</b>. In both procedures, they are asked to review and sign the attached draft of the engagement letter.</p>
        <p>At the top of the document, the status for this query is set to <b>Draft</b>. To submit the query to the client, change the status to <b>Open</b>. The Open Query dialog is displayed.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Client-engagement-letter-initial-request.png" />
        </p>
        <p>First, select a due date from the calendar menu. Next, assign the query to one of your client contacts. Deselect the checkbox beside <b>Assign to all contacts</b>. Select the contact search field that is displayed below it and then choose one of the contacts from the quick list. Finally, enter the following custom email message:</p>
        <p><i>Please review the attached engagement letter, sign it, and return it to us. If you notice any problems in the letter, please inform us at once.</i>
        </p>
        <p>Select <b>OK</b> to open the query. This also automatically updates the status of the engagement file to <b>Waiting on Queries</b>.</p>
        <p>The client will receive an email notifying them that there is an item in Cloud that requires their attention. When they log in, they will see your request under <b>My Work</b>.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="/Resources/Images/cloud-engagement-query-opened-contact-view-1134x460.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The client can download a copy of the PDF letter, review it, add their signature, and upload the signed document back to the same query. They can also add comments to the query, and these comments will be visible to your firm members in the engagement file.</p>
        <p>Once they have responded to all of the tasks on the query, they can mark the query as <b>Responded</b>. This updates the document status in the engagement file, and it also automatically updates the status of the engagement file to <b>Queries Ready</b>. Your client contacts can no longer see a query that has been marked as <b>Responded</b> on their Overview page, but they can still see the query on the <b>Activities</b> page.</p>
        <h2>Accept the signed engagement letter</h2>
        <p>When you review the query, you can see that the client has responded to the procedure, and you can either accept or decline the response by selecting the blue edit icon (<img src="/Resources/Images/Blue-edit-icon.png" />) next to the query. </p>
        <p>Once you accept the query, the signed letter is attached to the file, replacing the placeholder that was on the Documents page. The query will be locked to prevent any further editing.</p>
        <p>Mark the query as <b>Complete</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Client-responded-completed.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Go back to the Documents page. You'll see that the query is marked as complete, and the completed and signed engagement letter have both been added to the document list.</p>
        <p>
