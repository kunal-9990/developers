        <h1>Performing fieldwork </h1>
        <p>You have performed all of the steps involved in adding the trial balance information to your engagement file: 
		</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>submitted and accepted a query for the client’s trial balance file</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>imported the trial balance into the engagement file</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>assigned an unassigned account and corrected the mapping</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>added an annotation to the trial balance</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are now ready to perform fieldwork, the main part of the review engagement.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <h2>Working on checklists</h2>
        <p>On the Documents page there is a series of checklist documents under the <b>Performing</b> section. These checklists are leadsheet documents, and you will use them to guide your analysis and document the results of your inquiries for the relevant financial statement areas.</p>
        <p>Leadsheet checklists include supplemental sections that will help you to complete them more easily and quickly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Analysis</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Objective and Notes</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>linked query responses</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Open the <b>3-A Cash</b> document.</p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>At the top of each leadsheet document you will see an <b>analysis</b> section. This area pulls information from the trial balance and displays it in graphs or tables.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Cash-analysis.png" alt="Leadsheet documents contain an Analysis section, providing a helpful overview of your data." title="Leadsheet documents contain an Analysis section, providing a helpful overview of your data." />
        </p>
        <p>The analysis section presents data visually, and it only includes trial balance information for relevant accounts and groups, so it makes it easier to identify what inquiries you might need to make to your client as part of the engagement work.</p>
        <p>You can view either <b>preliminary</b> or <b>final</b> balances using the drop-down menu at the top of the section, and you can choose which graphs and tables to show by switching the display toggles. Each module also has a section where you can enter comments about the data displayed there.</p>
        <h3>Objective and Notes</h3>
        <p>Each leadsheet document also includes an <b>Objective and Notes</b> section. </p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Cash-objectives.png" alt="The Objectives and Notes section in the Cash leadshseet document." />
        </p>
        <p>Just as you saw in the engagement letter draft, this section contains information about the current document and guidelines on how to complete it. </p>
        <h3>Adding the client contacts</h3>
        <p>In the <b>Inquiries made of entity personnel</b> section contained at the top of every leadsheet, you can enter the names of the contacts you corresponded with to complete the inquiries, and the dates of correspondence.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Cash-inquiries.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Linked query responses</h3>
        <p>In the <b>Procedures</b> section of each leadsheet document, you see a list of questions to be answered or fields to fill in. If you are using the <b>2-03 Client inquiries - Questions</b> query document to gather information from your client, you may see <b>linked query responses</b> under some procedures.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-cash-and-cash-equiv-query-responses-1134x570.png" />
        </p>
        <p>These linked query response areas are linked to matching procedures in the <b>PBC Requests - Review Inquiries</b> query document. When you accept a response from a client in this query, the linked query response is displayed under the matching question on the leadsheet document.</p>
        <h2>Gathering more information from client</h2>
        <p>You are working on the Cash and Cash Equivalents document, and you reach a procedure that asks “<b>Has there been a proper cutoff of receivables/cash receipts and disbursements?</b>”</p>
        <p>In the analysis section, you noticed that the cash total for this year is much higher than the totals from the prior years. You decide to contact the customer to ask them to verify the response to this question, since a late cutoff could have inflated the current year total.</p>
        <p> Go to the Documents page and open the <b>PBC Requests - Review Inquiries</b> document. Scroll to the matching procedure. Select the <b>Comment</b> link under the procedure and enter some contextual information about what you want the client to confirm.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-query-review-inquiries-comment-for-client-1134x270.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note</b>: The Review Inquiries query includes linked queries for many different leadsheet documents. In normal engagement work, you should identify all the procedures where you need client input and delete the rest of the procedures from the query before submitting it to the client.</p>
        <p>Open the query. The client can enter information for the specific procedure and mark it as completed. You will see this response in the <b>PBC Requests - Review Inquiries</b> document, and if you are satisfied with the information they have provided then you can sign off on it. Select the Responded icon, and choose <b>Accept</b>.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-query-review-inquiries-select-accepted-1134x396.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once you have accepted the procedure in the query, you can see the client's response in the linked procedure on the leadsheet document.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/onpoint-cash-and-cash-equiv-client-response-shown-1134x392.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You can copy the client’s response to the query in the client response field, and if you are satisfied with the information they have provided then you can respond to the procedure and sign off on it.</p>
        <h2>Work on Microsoft Word or Excel files</h2>
        <p>If a member of the engagement team has attached files from Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel to your engagement, you can open these files to review the contents or make changes to them. On the <b>Documents</b> page, select a file to open it.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Open-additional-file.png" />
        </p>
        <p>When you enable editing in the Word or Excel file on your desktop, the file in your engagement is locked. Other members of the engagement team can open a read-only version of the file, but they will not be able to edit it until you have closed the file.</p>
        <p>An icon is displayed on the Documents page to let other members of the engagement team know when a file is locked.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Editing-additional-document.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Add annotations to PDF documents</h2>
        <p>You can open PDF documents that have been attached to the engagement by selecting them on the Documents page. While working on the engagement, you can add annotations to a PDF document to note work that you have performed or to identify problems or potential inaccuracies in the document.</p>
        <p>In the PDF file, select an area of the document to display the <b>Add Annotation icon</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Icons/SE icons/annotation-add-16x16.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />). If you select a line of text, the icon is displayed at the end of the line. Otherwise, it is displayed at the point you select.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-documents-pdf-add-annotation-1134x490.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the icon to add an annotation at the indicated spot. You will choose an annotation type, link the annotation to a document or adjustment (if applicable) and enter a description for the annotation.</p>
        <p class="image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Project Files/OnPoint/Images/onpoint-documents-pdf-add-annotation-enter-note-1134x490.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once you select <b>Save</b>, the annotation is added to the PDF. An icon indicates what type of annotation it is, and other engagement team members can view the annotation by hovering their cursor over it or by selecting it.</p>
        <p>Complete and get signoff on the remaining checklists and procedures in the <b>Performing</b> documents to complete the fieldwork for the engagement.</p>
